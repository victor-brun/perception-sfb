"1",1,"1","The main problem is illegal fishing: dynamite and cyanide fishing using compressors. For general environmental issues, I would say the garbage and probably overexploitation. When did they start, I would say probably since the area has been populated. For the plastic pollution problem, it has started as soon as the plastic industry arrived here. Also I think the other problem is cutting the mangroves, especially in the Shark Fin Bay area, and accompanying siltation because of soil erosion coming from the mountains when they do slash and burn farming like the kaingin. Road construction is inevitable, we have to construct roads. I think anywhere else in the world when you have road construction you will have siltation eventually, but that is the price to pay. ","Taytay"
"2",1,"2","It's the main source of livelihood for Filipinos. The main source of protein comes from fish for most Filipinos, so it's very important for us. Now that tourism is becoming more and more important as a source of livelihood and alternative source of livelihood, it makes the marine and coastal environment more important. The more we can protect it and keep it nice and beautiful with high biodiversity, I think the more attractive it becomes for tourists.","Taytay"
"3",1,"3","In the Shark Fin Bay, one of the main issues is illegal fishing. I am not sure if they have declining fish stocks but probably. Sulubaai, when they started, there were very few fish there and now there are even more fish. So I would say that the fish population has been depleted. I have head stories that Shark Fin Bay used to be very abundant in terms of fish. According to the Mayor, the fishing industry peaked mid 1980 to early 1990 and the Mayor predicted that in twenty years time. It was big purse seines boats, with lights. ","Taytay"
"4",1,"4","Establishment of MPA is one. But I think the more important thing is education of the coastal communities especially children about the value of marine environment and introduction of alternative livelihood including sustainable tourism enterprises that can somehow take away the pressure from the fishing. And then, in terms of conservation and education, it has to include the importance of waste management and most probably the reforestation of damaged mangrove areas.","Taytay"
"5",1,"5a","Mainly to protect and replenish the marine resources in an area. It needs rehabilitation and an MPA can also act as a means to rehabilite areas but the general idea is to have a safe refuge for fishes, not just fishes but all marine resources where they have a chance to reproduce and eventually spillover near by areas and at least improve the fisheries.","Taytay"
"6",1,"5b","I think the first to benefit are the local people nearby and the resource nearby who are showcasing these MPAs as tourist attractions. If the MPA is big enough, it can provide seeds for other fishing areas, then even the further communities can benefit. If the MPA is big enough that the mature fishes and whatever that is there can reproduce and reproduce and give seeds, fingerlings and fries that will move to other marine areas that are traditional fishing grounds that can even help the communities that are far from the MPA through receiving of their spillover effect. If you have a huge MPA, or the entire Shark Fin Bay as an MPA.","Taytay"
"7",1,"5c","You must have a monitoring and evaluation. Must have a before and after study, not just the fish stocks of the MPA, but also the fish catch of the communities and the values of the communities towards conservation of natural resources. If we can change the values of the communities in terms simply for sea turtles. If the community sees see turtles as more valuable alive than as meat, or the horseshoue crab, as they are more valuable for tourism, as more tourist will come to visit instead of eating the sea turtle one time. It is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.","Taytay"
"8",1,"6a","Mainly restoration of the habitat around Pangatalan island, but at the same time, community involvement providing help to the community in terms of employment, water supply, conservation, education, providing a more sustainable livelihood. At the same time, I think Sulubaai Foundation can also be a very good avenue for people outside the Philippines who has money and the resources that can help in supporting marine conservation in Taytay Bay. Basically, one of their objectives is also to fund sources that will support their conservation activities in the island and on the surrounding waters in the Shark Fin Bay and probably beyond as they grow bigger.","Taytay"
"9",1,"6b","I think their action is excellent, it is one of the best I have seen so far with the awards they have received and what I have been seeing in the island, and what I have been hearing from the people that are benefitting from them, they are doing a fantastic job. In terms of how it can be improved, Sulubaai should have someone who can really communicate very well with the local government so that the partnership can be strenghtened. The same as a community relations officer that can really relate to both the global aspect of Sulubaai foundation and the local needs and perspectives of the local communities. Something that can connect both the foundation and the community. They should have someone who is really good at connecting the two, as a medium. Sometimes, even if you have the purest intentions, but if your people midway that cannot communicate, is not conscious of the needs and of the local cultural situation in the community, that can create a disaster despite the purest conservation intentions. And improvement, I think the way they are doing is really good. I think they should really focus now on having that someone. Connecting Sulubaaï and LGUs and Sulubaaï and the communities. Sulubaaï, if they can strenghten their so-called social fence around Shark Fin Bay, I think that could really be their strongest pillar in terms of conservation for the Shark Fin Bay. If you have the support of the kids, and the teenagers and the older people there and then you have the support of the local politicians, then it would be very good. Also, I think it could be good to have someone who knows the intricacies of the local political situation so that they don't get politicized. You may have a Mayor now that is very good and has very good relationships with Sulubaai and then you have finally someone who is really opposed to that mayor. Even if Sulubaai has the best intentions, they could see them as ennemy just because they are with the opponent. Support the projects that are related to the objectives of the Sulubaai Foundation, but at the same time be independant enough, neutral enough that you can actually support anyone and also not alienating anyone. It is important to find someone that can find this very fine balance between being apolitical.","Taytay"
"10",1,"6c","Fantastic, but I think it is small. It has to expand. In line with the expansion, it has to also be tied more intimately with the community, and get the support from the community. Explain it well so thay can really have a support from the community.","Taytay"
"11",1,"7","From being a fully fishing dependent community as a resource of livelihood, I would rather want to see Shark Fin Bay as a model for marine biodiversity conservation that has a very strong partnership between private organizations like Sulubaai and the community and barangay and eventually elevating it with a more solid relationship with the municipal government. Having more tourism and local production based economy. When I say local production that could either be agriculture or mariculture, and of course sustainable and not polluting to the environment or at least controlled. And of course with citizens that are really aware of the importance of sustainability of the environment. And family with less kids, family plannings. Probably you have seen families with five or six kids. Well, nowadays, it has changed quite a bit. I have six other siblings, we are seven but no my brothers and sisters, I think the maximum is three at the moment so it is cut by half already, it is a very good step. We do not want to go with the one child policy of China, but it has to be between two to three, probably maximum.","Taytay"
"12",2,"1","For environmental issues here in Palawan, the number one is degradation of terrestrial resources as well as the flatlands and marine environment. It started when I was still young. The degradation in terms of forest is quite slow compared to other places in the Philippines.","Taytay"
"13",2,"2","Source of food for people, carbon sinks, habitats of local fauna which underictly has an impact to the lives of the people.","Taytay"
"14",2,"3","One of the issues now is the use of compressor because it is being coupled usually by the use of cyanide and dynamite. Dynamite fishing. For us it is not rampant but still it is a concern that should be addressed because it has several impacts to the fishery and the tourism. It started since then. If I compare it to the previous years, I would say the frequency of crimes pertaining to dynamite has slowed down today, or the number has declined compared to before. It has been almost daily in different places in Taytay Bay, particularly at the back of Casian Island, even in Depla. It was more rampant before. ","Taytay"
"15",2,"4","For me it is good to consider the visibility, because we have verified in our previous experiences that if we put law enforcers in different areas managed by the LGU. It is very obvious that the illegal activity that has been done before has stopped, and it is being drowned away to further places and areas. Pushed away from that site. We interpret it as the result of visibility. Then, the awarness of people. People should understand, and understanding results in cooperation. Making advocacy with their friends and fellows doing illegal fishing, to stop. Number three is the effective patrolling and apprehensions if available and if possible. The laws are already installed, there are so many laws, the problem for me is the implementation and how it is being carried out by people who have the strong conviction about protection. ","Taytay"
"16",2,"5a","The main goal of an MPA is spillover. Tourism is just a domino effect of the protection within the MPAs. For me, MPA is for food security basically. ","Taytay"
"17",2,"5b","It should be the people, especially the neighboring communities of the MPAs.","Taytay"
"18",2,"5c","For now there is the tool being used here to assess the effectiveness of the MPAs. We call it the MEAT, MPA Effectiveness Assessment Tool. And of course, the feedbacking for the socio-economic studies. It should be the people that will tell that an MPA is good based on the result of their fish catch, and for their economic life. ","Taytay"
"19",2,"6a","Sulubaai is a new foundation here in Taytay. For me they are so important especially in the Shark Fin Bay. We look at them as very good possible partners in the coming years and that could also influence the protection and rehabilitation of the Shark Fin Bay also to serve the people and communities in that particular areas. ","Taytay"
"20",2,"6b","If that would become a partnership that would florish between Sulubaai, the community and the LGU including the barangay, Sulubaai could really help by putting up social projects and fiscal projects and then projects that pertain to conservation so that the MPAs in particular in the Shark Fin Bay could improve to benefit the people in the coming years. ","Taytay"
"21",2,"6c","I am very much supportive in the creation of an MPA knowing that it would result in the improvement of people's lives in Taytay Bay and Shark Fin Bay. There would be no other means to redeem what has happened in the environment. MPA would be the best approach to consider. That is the reason why considering the importance of the LGU was convinced to declared the whole Taytay Bay as an MPA in the previous years.","Taytay"
"22",2,"7","I foresee a rehabilitated Taytay Bay and Shark Fin Bay, prosperous with marine resources and being managed cooperately and successfully by the people, the governments and by the stakeholders. I would like to see the future as a beautiful Shark Fin Bay and Taytay Bay. And of course an enthousiastic tourism industry. ","Taytay"
"23",3,"1","For example, a problem is mining. Commercial fishing and illegal fishing. It has been a long time now. And then, all the houses in coastal areas. For example here in Little Tondo, their waste is going directly in the water. And then for commercial. Here in the western part of Taytay, Malampaya Sound, there are so many commercial fishing vessels entering the protected area of Malampaya Sound. ","Taytay"
"24",3,"2","First for our everyday food. Main source of food of fisherfolk and our marginal fisherfolk. Also that is where we get our livelihood.","Taytay"
"25",3,"3","The low demand for fishing and the low price. The low catch. Because of illegal fishing activities. Illegal fishing by ways of dynamite and sodium cyanide. It started a long long time ago. When I was here, since 2007, that has been the main problem of our municipality. ","Taytay"
"26",3,"4","We have our revised Municipal Fisheries Code implemented here in the municipality of Taytay. It is efficient. We were implementing it since 2017 when it was revised. Then we have information education campaigns (IEC) in the barangays.","Taytay"
"27",3,"5a","If we have MPA we can protect our coastal resources like the spawning of broader fishes. We can protect the fingerlings ones. And then if we have MPAs, we can catch fishes more than enough.","Taytay"
"28",3,"5b","The communities like our fisherfolks. ","Taytay"
"29",3,"5c","Maybe it needs a 24/7 sancuatry guards, safeguarding and maintenance. Monitoring and surveillance of illegal activities withinin the area. ","Taytay"
"30",3,"6a","First I know is for environmental protection and conservation of coastal resources. Then, they give livelihoods for our marginal fishermen like in Depla and nearby barangays.","Taytay"
"31",3,"6b","Well, for Sulubaai, we have to coordinate with local government units (LGU) for example IEC so you can be with local government and academe. And for the rest Sulubaai is OK as far as I know. Coordination because if do not have coordination with barangay local government and municipal local government, they cannot pursue their vision and mission. ","Taytay"
"32",3,"6c","Big help to the community. ","Taytay"
"33",3,"7","If we pursue the protection and conservation of our coastal resources, there will be a lot of change in what happens. For example an increase in coastal resources. Then, population will be multiplied in the Shark Fin Bay. ","Taytay"
"34",4,"1","The problem is the illegals. And also all the trash that end up in the environment. For the illegals there are a lot of illegal logging in the mountains. Terramar arrived in 1986 and helped to control illegal fishing. At the beginning they had some pearl farms here and it diminished illegal fishing. ","Depla"
"35",4,"2","It is important for fishermen. They get some fish there. It is where they get their money for learning, and their food as well. They fish with hook and line there and sell their fish in the afternoon. There we get all what we need.","Depla"
"36",4,"3","The problem is that there are many illegals. For people who are legals it is much better as they can get a lot of help. The problem is really the illegals. It started a long time ago. And now there has been a great decrease, a reduction of such activities and we can count them on fingers.","Depla"
"37",4,"4","There should be some help to create executive orders or resolutions from barangay to make illegal and be more strict with the law. ","Depla"
"38",4,"5a","For officials, our thinking was to improve the future of our youth. Because for us if there is more and more people and less fish. So we want to give some help for the future generations. ","Depla"
"39",4,"5b","Locals people of the barangay of course. ","Depla"
"40",4,"5c","There needs to have security and guards and people who take care. Also need the respect of people for the MPA. ","Depla"
"41",4,"6a","Sulubaai is giving a lot of help for people, for jobs and for our trash. Sir Fred gave us recipients to put our trash. ","Depla"
"42",4,"6b","In my opinion their action is good. They have been giving us some help on environment. Sulubaai is helping the barangay.","Depla"
"43",4,"6c","","Depla"
"44",4,"7","There should be a better view, more beautiful. Also, there should be better livelihoods. ","Depla"
"45",5,"1","The primary environmental issue that we are facing here is the diminution of environmental resources because the local economy of those people are primarily dependent on these resources. So because of the depletion of those resources, it became the main issue as regards to the poverty problem that we are facing. Now it becomes a vicious cycle that whenever the poverty is there, and then environmental degradation is there, they are actually positively correlated. Plus, it is being exacerbated by the fact that people are increasing in numbers while the resources are not. So as times passes by, the problem becomes intense so that is the main issue that we have here. If you look at Palawan, I cannot tell you the exact time when environmental issues became apparent but perhaps it is better to tell you that Palawan is still relatively better than the others in terms of degradation of natural ecosystems. It is somehow more productive and the environment is relatively more intact than others because the beauty of Palawan is in its isolation away from the Philippines and so the influxes of the migrants is not as rapid as the others. So what made us relatively preserved. But in the avent of transport boom, tourism arrived, the transport by plane became easy and so a lot of movement of people from the outside. It started maybe 20 years ago. And it is becoming worse as time goes on. ","Taytay"
"46",5,"2","Well of course because of the local economy, and the existence of the people. The majority of people living on the coasts are dependent on the coastal ecosystems that they will derive their subsistence. If you look at the economic activitiy of Palawan, specifically in Taytay, most people here are fishermen. Although they may be both farmers and fishermen, there are more farmers than the fishermen. Well maybe because it is always near the sea or along the coast where people can start their living, and where the migrants came. Their first landing area is the landing area. It offers a lot of opportunity to the people because you can navigate, the accessibility of transport is there and the resources can be easily harvested as you don't have to plant. In the coastal communites you don't have to plant anything. You can have it caught wild.","Taytay"
"47",5,"3","The main issues of fishing in the Shark Fin Bay again can be derived from the first answer. The fish is in resource degradation and of course there are many factors for which the resources are being degraded. In the Shark Fin Bay, because it is a bay, a sound, there are the focus of the marginal fishermen activities. Mostly people along the shoreline activities are doing the fishing in the Shark Fin Bay. Coupled with the fact that there are unsustainable resources use like for instance the use of blast fishing, poisonous or noxious substances, the use of fine nets, the catching of small not so marketable size fish. This exacerbated the problem. Plus the fact that if you disturb the natural food web or food chain in the natural ecosystem like the coral reef or mangroves, you would also affect the whole populations that depend on that cycle. If you have perhaps observed the parrotfish are decreasing in numbers. The effect is there will be not enough parrotfish anymore. The sargassum and algae will cover the reef, something like that. There are more than that.","Taytay"
"48",5,"4","The national law is there, the local legislation pertaining to the sustainable use of natural resources and particularly fisheries is already existing. The problem is that the law is not being implemented of course. The issue is of course on the implementing. Aside from that is not being followed the populations there is no popular support for that maybe because of their myopic view of the local economy. Perhaps the solution is to decrease the pressure on fisheries so that you can give time to the fishery resources to regenerate itself before we can do the harvesting. Now how do we do that, maybe to lessen the pressure on fisheries we should provide some other sources of livelihoods for the fishermen. But the question is what kind of livelihood is suitable for them, right? Maybe we should increase the efficacy of the enforcement of the fishery laws so that the natural resources for the fisheries will be abated. So two things: economics and law enforcement is I think the solution for that. ","Taytay"
"49",5,"5a","MPA is good, because in MPAs it is where the resources are being especially protected, regulated. It is not an open-access to the general community because there are regulations that are put, conditions or controls or limits to its use. And of course, MPA in the light of regeneration of resources is good because they serve as breeding ground for all the fishery resources. Plus, if they will have a spill-over effect outside MPA this will be harvested for the goods of the outside MPAs. They serve as a repository for the resources. ","Taytay"
"50",5,"5b","The fishermen around MPAs are the first to benefit of MPAs because in the first place they are the one catching the fishery resources. So it is them, there are no other than that, except perhaps for the traders of the products, and as well for the consumers outside of the MPAs but the first benefits will be for those fishermen that would be harvesting near the protected area. ","Taytay"
"51",5,"5c","The easies way to determine if an MPA is efficient is to conduct on-site evaluation of the area. Evaluations of the resources, before or prior to the establishment, during the establishment and after some years after the establishment of an MPA. That is the first thing we should do, to look at what is there that changes for the better. But we have to put a basis, or a baseline data for comparison. Next is, we can scale the efficiency of an MPA from the basket of fishermen themself. If thir catch per unit of effort (CPUE) is high, that's good, but if their catch is still low after the MPA is established, I think something is wrong. So to ensure that this will stay efficient, again, we go to the question of law enforcement. And providing other sources of livelihoods for the fishermen. Now we are talking only of the fishermen that are there, that are marginal, that are local fishermen. We have also to consider the fact that it is impreative for MPAs to be preserved. Not to allow the outsiders to participate to the fishing inside the MPA. So by all means, the community around the MPA should guard the MPA for themselves. Not allowing anyone outside to enter that area because it is for tham, that is why it is declared MPA in the first place. So you just have to have a recess time for the resources and after that the spillover will go outside and you can catch them. And then the area itself will be teeming with natural resources. Teeming with fish, crustaceans, mollusks or whatever.","Taytay"

"55",5,"7","If we leave it that way, leaving the people in their own way of treating the resources, well it is doomed to destruction. Because every resources become like that, the tragedy of the commons so to speak that would happen in the Shark Fin Bay. Aside from that, there are also issues of illegal fisheries in the Shark Fin Bay. There is also this big issue of change in the climate that could somehow affect the natural process of everything in the Shark Fin Bay. Plus the fact that people are increasing in numbers and that not all of them have alternative sources of livelihoods and not all of them become educated to have other livelihoods. The number of people around the Shark Fin Bay will just add in numbers. If we provide it with environmental interventions, economic interventions, perhaps it's not really an utopian future, but at least we can minimize, or we can delay the future destruction. ","Taytay"
"56",6,"1","Unsustainable fishing practices are an issue. Illegal logging of forestries. In the south we have mining. We have a problem of solid waste management. So I think that is one of the major issues right now here. I think unsustainable fishing practices started year 2010. Way back to 20 years ago, or 25 years ago, Malampaya Sound is known as the ""fish bowl"" of the Philippines. Illegal loging started I think in the 1980s. But for mining I am not sure about this, because this is mostly in the south of Palawan","Taytay"
"57",6,"2","I think it is very important for sustainable fishing. There are no reserves. It has to be sustainable for the long term because people are too dependent on our natural resources. They have no other alternative livelihoods than fishing. Palawan is an island and people are very dependent, they are coastal communities. ","Taytay"
"58",6,"3","I think their methods of fishing is their problem now. Because they do not observe the closed or open seasons in fisheries. Also they do not respect the sizes of catch. And also the implementation of MPAs, because the locals are not very collaborative and do not have less priority to establish these zones in some areas. So that is why the resources are getting depleted. The general lack of empowerment of our guards. There are not a lot of guards. ","Taytay"
"59",6,"4","Actually right now we are implementing MPAs in the Taytay Bay. Not only in the Taytay Bay but also in the Malampaya Sound. I think another solution is increase the capacity of locals. So that even if there is not us or you, they can manage their area. Also about the regulations and policies that they have there. ","Taytay"
"60",6,"5a","The goal of an MPA is to produce more fish and conserve our marine areas. Everyone does not utilize them, we have multiple-use zones so that if some want to fish, they can fish in order to get sustainable fisheries for a long time. ","Taytay"
"61",6,"5b","It is the locals. And of course the market of Taytay, and other municipalities like El Nido because Taytay is the source of fish for El Nido. The resorts come here and this is where they get their stocks. ","Taytay"
"62",6,"5c","To be sure that MPA are efficient, it depends on the state of the guarding. The collaboration between the locals, the conservation agencies, the national and the local agencies. I think that it is very important to secure our MPAs. Because if it is only the locals, they might not know, and we need to guide them at some point. ","Taytay"

"64",6,"6b","","Taytay"
"65",6,"6c","","Taytay"
"66",6,"7","If our unsustainable fishing practices continue, it will get difficult to get the fish as they are declining. The fish populations. We can feel it in the markets, we can almost not buy anymore. I think if we get to establish MPAs, so, we will have more breeders and the fish populations will increase. I think people will also become less dependent on fishing if they are more educated. ","Taytay"
"67",7,"1","So many problems. Usually there are so many illegal activities. I think the wildlife poaching such as balinton. The marine turtles. For terrestrial, I think the kaingin, or slash and burn. In the summer, there is really a lot of kaingin. Then, illegal cutting of trees. For Palawan maybe, here it is.","Taytay"
"68",7,"2","Of course because the communities here in Palawan rely on coastal resources. That's why it is so important. Palawan communities, I think, 70% is fisherfolks. Even here in Taytay. The major communities are relying on marine resources. For livelihood of course, that is why it is important. For environmental aspects of course, it is also important because they are the one helping us for climate change ; they help for storm surges, our corals, seagrass and mangroves that are really important because they are the nursery grounds of fishers, shrimps, and of all the sea in the sea. They are nursery grounds. Connected eachothers: mangroves and seagrass are connected, if we lose one, there is an imbalance. In fact there are a lot of important things important about the coastal environment. If there are lost, there is low income, they will get other jobs, and nothing more given by the coastal environment.","Taytay"
"69",7,"3","I think one of the problems here is the illegal activities, especially dynamite, sodium cyanide, commercial fishing before. In 2005 maybe, but maybe 2003 I think, when I was in LGU year 2000 but then I was assigned at minerals and 2005 in agriculture and especially fisheries. When I was in MENRO, there were reports on agriculture, I think they caught illegal fishermen using dynamite. But I think before that there was already. But I was not yet at government at the time.","Taytay"
"70",7,"4","When it comes to illegal activities, the government and especially the LGU, actually, the activites are within the municipal waters. If the activities are within the municipal waters, the LGU should have their intervention. Especially in law enforcement. When it comes to illegal activities, they should have law enforcement activities. One of the best ways is to establish MPAs. Actually, Taytay bay has three MPAs: Denot fishery fish and sanctuary, Tecas Reef, and the Black Rock. Pangatalan Island is de facto MPA. It is like Terramar with the Pearl Farms. The area, they protect it and no one can get inside. For me, if there are investors, they are the one that can help us tu protect and conserve the environment. It is okay for me but of course you have to follow the laws, guidelines, processes and papers. ","Taytay"
"71",7,"5a","For me the goal is to protect the best resources that there are. Excellent or good corals right? If you establish MPAs you have to find the good or excellent ones so that there are the one that we should protect. Because of course, where there are beautiful corals, there are more fish. So, we should protect them so there are nursery grounds not to be affected. It is a ""set aside area"" where the fish can multiply and spillover. MPA is a beautiful concept. The only problem is for its management. Actually, when I was in the LGU, I was the only on the management of Tecas Reef. The commercial fishing like ""basgni"" we could catch these. Unfortunately, I'm the one in the list that should leave from the municipality.","Taytay"
"72",7,"5b","Of course, first of all, the fisherfolks who depend in the marine environment. But if the management of management know who to manage not only for fishing purposes, they can promote it also for tourism activities. In MPAs you can only see good resources only in MPAs, not outside, because outside it is pretty broken everywhere. So it depends on the management of MPAs. If they want to become benefit to people for fishing purposes, they can protect it. But if they want to promote it not only for fishing, I mean for protection but for tourism purposes only, so that's the one means to help fisherfolks for tourism. ","Taytay"

"76",7,"6c","","Taytay"
"77",7,"7","If the local government, national agencies or the community, if they protect the area, of course it will become as a consequence, more beautiful. The fish will come back. There are actually crocodiles in Batas, right? Their habitat is broken as well. If the LGU together with the communities and other agencies protect the Shark Fin Bay, so, there is the possibility that the fish comes back and multiply. And augment the diversity of fish. It will become happier especially for the fisherfolk as they are primarily the one getting benefits from the area. But if they don't protect it, the dynamite and sodium will continue. I don't know if there is still dynamite. When I was at the LGU we had an organization. We did not really move as the municipilaty was not very active.","Taytay"
"78",8,"1","1980s, was the worse I think. 70s transition to 80s when mangroves were converted into fishponds and government supported the development of fish farms for more fish production. But later they realized it's not advantage to the environment and they stopped maybe in the late 90s. So, from there, also, 70s and 80s disruptive fishing gears like bombs and poisonous substances to catch fish until again they realized the little fish left in the ocean. During that time, trawling and other means of distructive fishing were rampant. It was only late 90s or mid-90s that here in Palawan there were regulations to stop. But in other fishing grounds it was since 60s or 70s, outside Palawan. But we are talking only about Palawan.","Puerto Princesa"
"79",8,"2","I like nature. I like to see nature around me. So, I don't want it to be destroyed. Secondly, there is also food. Natural food ; not from the restaurant and factories. Fresh. And later, the services. If you have trees and mangroves, if there is typhoon, the wind will not be so disruptive. As a person, I like nature, I swim around. First time I came here in 1981, when I dived, playing underwater, ""this is the place for me, I don't want to go home"". I am not from here, I am from Panay Island, Visayas.","Puerto Princesa"
"80",8,"3","Honda Bay, Taytay Bay and Shark Fin Bay have very similar problems like overfishing. Taytay is better but here in Puerto Princesa it is more about development, road construction, sedimentation and development. Tourism is good but if not regulated it becomes a problem. And now, Puerto Princesa has a very fast developing tourism. Good for Taytay it is the El Nido which is target. But Taytay is developing their own tourism plan; better if it is already established before it becomes full-blown tourist area. That's the advantage of Taytay, it can still plan and implement. But Puerto Princesa is not bad but there are more threats: pollutants from industry, more people, informal settlers. Waste. ","Puerto Princesa"
"81",8,"4","Well from my experience, it is a combination. If only one that could be political will from the leaders. Second, money, funding. Third, knowledge and capacity to manage. I think that's the upper solutions. Of course there are many down the line. But I always see that without political will, money can't do anything. Budget cannot do anything. If you have money, you have political money and you don't know how, also; so it's a combination. Illegal fishing here before, in Puerto Princesa, it's an actual story that our previous mayor. Trawl fishing and bombing in Puerto Princesa Bay, it's very small. During that time, 80s, from here we can hear bomb. Because at the back of the school it is Puerto Princesa Bay. We an hear boom. And many trawl boats for shrimps, and shells. Even cyanide. Hookah, modified hookahs. Sometimes, boom and then compressor. So the mayor identified. Of course everybody knows everybody. They organized meetings for illegal fishers: ""what's your problem, okay the city gives you this boat, another boat, change livelihood"". Because the problem is always poverty. You have no money, you have to but of course it's not always true, it's greed. So, sample of the political will, the government gave money to the support for them to change their livelihood. Another one is the development of tourism. People, fishermen convert to boat operators, tourguides, swimming guides, so less effort in fishing. In Honda Bay now you can see less fishing and more tourism. And also El Nido. Puerto Princesa will be like El Nido later. It is very difficult because again the political will, they have money because they charge every tourist. But where is the money? It is not used to sustain, to maintain, to manage. But tourism is one solutions I can see. It's a good solution but you have to plan and regulate. ","Puerto Princesa"
"82",8,"5a","One is biodiversity, second is sustainable fisheries. I think that's the main objective. Some call community-based MPAs blabla to help the communities. But it's the same, if you do not have biodiversity you would not have the livelihood. Whoever manages it, the important thing is that it's effectively managed.","Puerto Princesa"
"83",8,"5b","Of course it's environment, nature. Second, people. The fishermen, because it's their livelihood. And their families. They are the direct beneficials. But there are bigger MPAs managed by the national Government. They are six around the Philippines and maybe two around here. The NIPAS. Supposed to be bigger MPAs that would have greater impacts, but no evaluations. They don't want to evaluate that. ","Puerto Princesa"
"84",8,"5c","Evaluation. Regular monitoring. Not only physically but effectiveness to the beneficials. First it would serve the marine ecosystem and then which would benefit to the fishermen, the community. ","Puerto Princesa"

"88",8,"7","Looking at Taytay to be improved, not so much developed but environment friendly tourism. More income for the communities. It's a question because there is many resources in Taytay Bay when the communities are poor. It's a more diversity but less money for the fishermen and farmers. That's the challenge in Taytay. There are few who manage to have income: the owners of the Islands of these blabla hotels. But the majority are poor. I don't know if it would be developed, more income for them. For employment. But better if they will have their own farms, organic and serve the guests of tourism with quality food rather than make roads and hotels and etc. Maybe a more laid back tourism something like that. For me, I don't know with others because businessmen have different opinion. You don't destroy you develop the nature. After all, tourists like nature, they don't like buildings because they come from so much buildings already. That's my concept. ","Puerto Princesa"
"89",9,"1","The fish became scarce. Back then the catch of fish were beautiful but now it is difficult already. In year 2008 it started. Year of 1970s it was still beautiful. 1980 and 1990 it was still quite good. But when it arrived to 2000, 2001 up, it was already difficult. Also, there is illegal fishing such as ""boom boom"", cyanide. That's it.","Sandoval"
"90",9,"2","Because we get a lot of our incomes from the ocean. The earnings from fishing. Then, the livelihood in the ocean is not a burden.","Sandoval"
"91",9,"3","","Sandoval"
"92",9,"4","We need to put guards so that illegals don't enter. ","Sandoval"
"93",9,"5a","To get more fish.","Sandoval"
"94",9,"5b","MPAs are for local people, right? People from the barangay.","Sandoval"
"95",9,"5c","We need to put boundaries, and so there are also guards. For example, in the area of Sandoval, there are boundaries until Batas. Like that, there is guards on the area and the illegals cannot enter.","Sandoval"
"96",9,"6a","They improve the marine environment.","Sandoval"
"97",9,"6b","Beautiful. If there is action like this, the environment will get better. The illegals cannot enter. Then there is protection, the fish can spawn and will increase in numbers. ","Sandoval"
"98",9,"6c","Also beautiful, it's okay. ","Sandoval"
"99",9,"7","We need to get such a system. People that guard so that the marine environment is not broken.","Sandoval"
"100",10,"1","In the ocean, there is boom boom. The environment is beautiful. Before, it was more beautiful. Now for example, there are a lot of kaingin, many people who cut the trees.","Depla"
"101",10,"2","Of course, because it is where our livelihood and earnings from. So we try to always take care of our environment. We live from it.","Depla"
"102",10,"3","Before, it was still beautiful here. The big boats were forbidden and it started becoming more beautiful. Terramar also arrived and they started arresting illegals. Now there are still a few illegals, but there is more guard and so there are less now.","Depla"
"103",10,"4","For the illegals, we need to catch them so that our catch becomes more beautiful again.","Depla"
"104",10,"5a","I think like in Pangatalan, it became a bit more beautiful with the protection for the fishery. There are guards and no illegals there.","Depla"
"105",10,"5b","Of course, the locals of Depla.","Depla"
"106",10,"5c","","Depla"
"107",10,"6a","It is a big help for people here in barangay Depla from Pangatalan. For example, there are the one getting a work there. People are thankful that Pangatalan came here.","Depla"
"108",10,"6b","It is really beautiful. It is a big help for Depla.","Depla"
"109",10,"6c","It is beautiful to have forbidden fishing there, because it is a spawning ground for fish inside the sanctuary. It is good to have such nurseries for fishes, like the corals. The fishermen cannot enter there because it is the nursery for fishes. Then people will get benefit from it when the fish go out further. They can go out of the MPA to the sea and then we can catch them they could go out. If they go out further out of the sanctuary, then they belong to us because they are outside. It is good. We should also stop tubli at the low tide, because people get the smallest fish. In the month of december, low tide is great. If a sanctuary is made, it is good because there are guards. If the fish are very small they can grow up then. Sanctuary is good.","Depla"
"110",10,"7","If this continues, the future of people here will be more beautiful. A sanctuary for example so the fish increase in numbers. People will have good earnings. ","Depla"
"111",11,"1","Forbidden illegals. Because they break our ocean, it is getting completely depleted. There is only a little bit left. Illegal trees cutting like that. Of course there will be landslides. It started a very long time ago. I was born in 1952. Of course, our anestors as well.","Depla"
"112",11,"2","For me, it has a value because for example, for our fellows, for our children, we get benefits from it. It is getting completely depleted, we could put MPAs like that. For everyone else it has a value because we get what we need, our food, from the ocean.","Depla"
"113",11,"3","There should not be sodium. Of course that's natural, if there is sodium, all the fish will go out of the Shark Fin Bay's area. It has been long time, it is hard to say if there is still some or if there is no more. We should have a beautiful MPA in the barangay in order to avoid other people to get our natural resources.","Depla"
"114",11,"4","For me, it's good if we get an MPA because I haven't heard people saying to forbid people there. Everyone says ""let's have an MPA"".","Depla"
"115",11,"5a","In order to get more fish, shells, for everyone that get benefits.","Depla"
"116",11,"5b","This MPA is only for barangay. It is for people here in barangay.","Depla"
"117",11,"5c","What I know is that we should get security. Then, we should get people from the barangay that should avoid this MPA. For example, we forbid this area in boundaries.","Depla"
"118",11,"6a","The goal of Sulubaai Foundation is good. They give a lot of help. For example near them we can ask for (). If we have projects in the barangay, they can also help. ","Depla"
"119",11,"6b","It is okay, as people say.","Depla"
"120",11,"6c","OK, yes we agree.","Depla"
"121",11,"7","If we have an MPA, if we take care, in the end maybe we will get more fish. Which is why we should get protection for local people here, with an MPA like this. Of course, it's possible that we don't get a beautiful future, if we have still people coming from other barangays and no guards.","Depla"
"122",12,"1","First, the problem for the ocean is illegal fishing. This is the problem for the ocean. For instance, cyanide, as well as dynamite. On land, there is also. Sometimes we cannot avoid to have people doing kaingin, because of poverty, the residents of barangay. It is normal, they cut the trees, we also can't avoid the cutting of large trees to make good lumber. In my estimation, it started a long time ago.","Depla"
"123",12,"2","First, this is where we get what we need for a living. Like net fishermen or hook and line fishermen. ","Depla"
"124",12,"3","First Sir, the issue now is that the catch of fishermen are decreasing. Maybe because of illegals. Because if you are illegal, it means that even the semilla of fish will happen to die. Then, first, the corals because of dynamite explosions, will happen to be broken. So it will happen that there will be no more spawning ground for fish.","Depla"
"125",12,"4","The solution sir, is that we will be doing a marine protected area here so that fishermen cannot enter. This has to be the spawning ground of fish for Barangay Depla.","Depla"
"126",12,"5a","The goal of MPA like thit is good. First, there is the spawning ground of fish. They get protection so that fishermen cannot enter, especially illegal fishermen.","Depla"
"127",12,"5b","MPAs are for next generations like our children, grandchildren, like that.","Depla"
"128",12,"5c","First, to become efficient, we need this MPA to protect the people from the barangay so that other fishermen for example from other barangay enter.","Depla"
"129",12,"6a","The Sulubaai foundation first provides help to our barangay. If we have a problem in the barangay, they are the ones giving for example help to us.","Depla"
"130",12,"6b","The help is beautiful, for example for water. They have given us abundant water, we don't have to walk so much anymore and water does not get depleted. For example the water to wash.","Depla"
"131",12,"6c","Yes we agree because first, the fish from MPA of Pangatalan, they go out and hook and line fishermen can catch then, you just don't enter because it is forbidden to enter inside the MPA. Fishermen often fish near Pangatalan. ","Depla"
"132",12,"7","In my opinion Sir, if Sulubaai continues like that, they will be our help to make more beautiful and improve our environment wether it is at sea or in the mountains.","Depla"
"133",13,"1","Difficult. It is really difficult. It is difficult in Palawan. There is no good livelihood in Palawan. People from Palawan don't have a work. Only kainging. When it is amihan like this we cannot really fish. So it is difficult because of the weather, amihan is strong, we cannot fish. Waves are strong. There are still fish. For the baklad, during abagat it is weak but during amihan many fish are entering. It is because the sea is more turbid. For them during abagat, the livelihood is not good. For hook and line fishermen, it is better because the weather is more calm.","Depla"
"134",13,"2","Because God gave us the ocean. It has to be worshipped. He said worship the ocean that I give to people. So this is the livelihood, spearfishing, for old people. This is their livelihood. So the fish, their capture, is the livelihood of people.","Depla"
"135",13,"3","There are a lot. For example, when your livelihood is to get live fish, there are bad people that will steal your fish. Then, when you get back there there are no more. You stand up and you fall because there are no more. So, people having this livelihood, that hide their fish, get their fish stolen from others. The others are the one selling the fish, and you are the one that got tired. And nothing happens, it is difficult for hook and line fishermen. Then, like now, there are a lot of illegal fishermen as we call them. There are illegal fishermen and then, the fish are going further because near the shore, corals of the sea are broken. So the fish are going further and the small fishermen don't get a lot. They get the fish over there far away. They use a container of gasoline to be able to get a catch. This is the problem to the environment of the fish. And so people are getting more poor because of the environment that people get. Do you know, here in Palawan, it is really difficult if you don't have a livelihood in the sea. People get their livelihood from the ocean, but many are also opposing to that. Illegals are the opposants to the legal livelihoods. Because of that, we lose our catch sometimes because the fish are far away already. They are over there. And here, near the shore, we cannot ever catch them because also many mangroves have been destroyed. So the fish... they are going further. Just like our place, the place that you went to in Bilaya. They have guards there so that people don't go there. But they are mocking them because when you are not there, they are going fishing and the fish are going further. So our children here are getting poorer. What we have to do, if it is amihan like that, it is difficult.","Depla"
"136",13,"4","The solution for our environment, first, is to make ways so that there are no effect to corals and fish. We should protect them. And the fish will come closer again. Because if there is no guards, we will have problems. Because there are people coming in. And so nothing will happen. And after some time, after some time, no more... No more fish. A difficult time. If there are no guards, no more. The guards, sometimes, are the bantay dagat. This is the problem here in Palawan. The environment is beautiful in Palawan. We say that Palawan is beautiful but there are also a lot of differents. Before, right next to the shore, you could get a lot of catch. Now, you have to go far away sometimes. Before there were saging saging that could reach two kilos. Before, we could get mamsa over eight kilos. ","Depla"
"137",13,"5a","Sanctuaries. Just like Terramar. Their goal is to help people. We don't need to fish far away, because the fish go in and out. Because if the corals are beautiful in the depths, the habitats of the fish are beautiful, too. They can enter, and then go inside the mangroves, and spawn there. The fish won't leave if their habitat is beautiful. It is like the kalapato, they have a habitat in the sand. You often see them in the sand. This one for example will not leave. This one also leaves in the sandy areas. They are all different. But in the corals, if they are beautiful, the fish don't leave because they have a lot of food there. But when it comes to dynamite fishing for example, there are no more. You won't see fish until far away. Because they go deeper and deeper. If you go in Terramar, they have security. When you arrive, the security comes. When we go there, we fish dalagang bukid. We use shrimp as a bait and a hook big like that. We tight the shrimp like that. Sometimes the guards are five. Sometimes, they fish as well. When amihan is like that, we go there at the boundary because the livelihood is good there in their protected area. They also protect their environment. I am Pastor. I went there and I told them: ""I am Pastor Cabalda"". I can enter there because they know that I am not fishing in illegal ways. If they see my bangka and fish all the afternoon, afterwards they come to me and ask ""did you catch a lot?"". And I say ""I already have some"". So this is our livelihood during amihan and our bait is shrimp for dalagang bukid. Then, we also target suno, the one we keep alive.","Depla"
"138",13,"5b","","Depla"
"139",13,"5c","There needs to be guards. If it is like terramar, they have hours. They they go around and really guard their area. They each have different areas. The fish are calibrating according to illegal fishermen. They are there, inside the ropes. They are multiplicating because of the algae. They are eating the algae. If you are going there as an illegal fisherman, they are pursuing you and you go to Taytay, they catch you. If you are only fishing with hook and line, it is okay because it is legal.","Depla"
"140",13,"6a","The one I know is Fred. He speaks English but we did not really study English. He does not really speak Tagalog so it is difficult to discuss. I am also scared to talk in English. But when it's like you, you really studied Tagalog. Here in Palawan, the national language is Tagalog. Cuyonin, like to Ma'am Chris, I told to her in Cuyonin where are you going, ""adin ka galing"", and she did not reply because she did not understand (laughters). But for you if you understand you will reply ""duto kami aggaling sa Pangatalan"". Right? Like when you come with Camille. For Sulubaai, I think what they are doing is good. First, it is good that they help people, here at ours in Depla. Because they are doing a lot to help. First, what he did to help people from Depla, he gave us water. Second, the are jobs there in Pangatalan. When it's like that, people from Depla will not get poor. Otherwise, their job is far away... El Nido. Many get jobs there. This is why I am telling that what he is doing is good. He has ben helping people from Depla not to get poorer. For example now, the MPA at his, if he takes care of the environment, if the habitat is beautiful already, right, there are many fish there because of the protection. And it also helps people here that are getting poorer in these last times. In these last times, fish are getting further.","Depla"

"143",13,"7","For this question, my answer, is that if there is improvement of the place, there will be effect for people. And then no problem. But if there are no guards, there is a big problem, it will become more difficult. Before, we used to fish with hook and line, until now. Before and now are very different. The fish will be really depleted. You won't get anymore catch just like in other areas, further, like Bohol. There are people I know in Bohol, and they have to work far away. So people from Bohol are coming here in Palawan, work here and send there. Here in Palawan, there are a lot of fish but if there are no guards to the environment, they will be lost and will get further, and deeper because of the absence of guards. But if like before there are guards here, in areas where the fish can multiply, place where they can lay their eggs, the environment will not be breaking and will be more beautiful. If there are no guards, nothing will happen. If there are no guards, they will keep on what they are doing. We have seen here in the area that there are many illegal fishermen that enter. But if there are guards, they cannot enter. If the government is efficient, they will get caught. What need to be done is them to get legal livelihoods. They will get controled. If they are caught, they have a penalty. If they have a penalty, they will then get a legal livelihood and not keep on being illegal because they will be scared to be caught. Because if it stops, they will all be consumed, because for me they use their money quick.","Depla"
"144",14,"1","There is no improvement in salaries. There are a lot of illegal fishermen in the ocean. On land it is the same. There is tree cutting, illegal cutting of trees. In the ocean, there is boom boom. Then there is sodium.","Sandoval"
"145",14,"2","There we get our subsistence, with fishing. ","Sandoval"
"146",14,"3","The corals are dying, there is no more habitat for the fish. Because of things such as sodium. Coral are dying. They are doing illegals for the benefits of it, and there are no more benefits.","Sandoval"
"147",14,"4","We need guards. There could still be problems of illegal fishermen. If they had other livelihood options maybe they would stop but there is no other livelihood.","Sandoval"
"148",14,"5a","So that the fish come back. Like that, the ones breaking the corals cannot enter. To control them.","Sandoval"
"149",14,"5b","For people also, people living here near Pangatalan, near the protected area such as Sandoval... Depla. There are a lot of fish, a lot of seafood.","Sandoval"
"150",14,"5c","When there are a lot of people, if you try to control them sometimes they do not really stop. In barangay here it is the same, they use illegal methods like sodium, boom boom. In Barangay and in the Municipality they need to help us. From the Barangay Captain as well. Help to better control the illegal fishermen.","Sandoval"
"151",14,"6a","They protect the environment. Like that. They give assistance to the controls of the Municipality.","Sandoval"
"152",14,"6b","It is good. They can give more help to arrest illegal fishermen.","Sandoval"
"153",14,"6c","Yes I agree.","Sandoval"
"154",14,"7","Good. We will develop if we arrest illegals. If we don't arrest them we will not develop. We need guns, if we don't have guns it will be more difficult to arrest them (laughters).","Sandoval"
"155",15,"1","Really, deforestation. There are no more trees, so there are landslides. It's a problem to nature, right? Floods Year 2013. It takes a long time. Maybe 2016.","Sandoval"
"156",15,"2","Because it's the primary habitat of fish, especially dolphins, and organisms that live in water. For example, fishermen depend for their income, their money. Fishing like sea cucumbers. But now it's dangerous fishing in the sea.","Sandoval"
"157",15,"3","The fishermen are getting low catches. Then, the other kinds of animals living in the sea are also endangered. They are also decreasing in numbers because of course we need money. We need to feed our family, so people tend to do that because to survive their family. Maybe because of people but some is nature. For example, coral reefs are getting degraded. They don't have anymore habitat. So they are decreasing and decreasing in numbers. ","Sandoval"
"158",15,"4","Proper discipline if the people are oriented, updated or well educated about the nature, how they love it. How they can take care of it. The solution has to come from the people. I am teatching now overthere at Nacpan Beach, not here, so I cannot really make a promess about here, to teach the students. Maybe overthere, because Nacpan Beach is one of the most touristic spots here. I am teaching the kids how to handle their litter, throw their trash in the right container. They need to separate.

They transfer, migrate to other living areas, where they can live properly. They can feel that their house is broken. They also can feel that people care. Animals are very sensitive in their feelings. If they know that people care about them, they stay with you. If not... So look into other places.","Sandoval"
"166",16,"1","I'm not sure Sir. Problems to the environment Because the catch of fish are really weak. Maybe because many are throwing the trash there. Sometimes the skins of kashew that are threw in the rivers. Of course then the river goes to the ocean and then breaks the fish. Pollution. This is the only thing I can really think about now. I noticed this. Back in the days, quickly, you could get a lot of fish. Now it's more difficult.","Sandoval"
"167",16,"2","Because this is where most people are getting their money. They are fishermen. This is why the ocean is really important for us.","Sandoval"

"171",16,"5b","In my opinion, it's not only for resorts overthere. It is for us all. Because the fish even you feed them there, they leave to go to deeper places. They come and go. It means that all of us get benefits from these fish.","Sandoval"

Because if there is no solution, their illegal activities will continue. It is the same in the forests, if we do not solve the cutting of trees, of course, after a while, all the trees will be gone. There is the possibility of course to get floods. Landslides. Then it is the same in the sea. There will be no more for our grandchildren, they will get nothing. The users of sodium, of trawl, are breaking the corals. The seaweeds as well. Of course, this is the habitat of the fish that we get. They will be depleted as well. So nothing will happen when the future comes. Nothing will become a beautiful future for the sea. ","Mabini"

"245",23,"3","Problems to fishermen It has been a long time. They get few fish maybe. Yes that's it, few fish. Do you know sometimes, shells are dying. Maybe they lack of luck.

"265",25,"1","It is very difficult in palawan. The trash is the real issue, it comes from El Nido. Also the water, it comes directly in the ocean. The dirty water from the hotels. Some others are getting wood, mangroves. Even in the forests, they catch the forests, and then the problems go into the ocean. In the ocean, thanks to god, here there is no dynamite fishing.","Mabini"
"266",25,"2","Of course because it is a resource. It is valuable. It is the resources for local people. There we are getting our resources: seaweeds, fish. I think there is no other reason. It has value, of course we have to protect the environment, it is important. It is not the same for everyone, there are some taking care while others don't. But what we should do is to take care of the environment so that our resources don't get lost. We are losing what we get if our environment is depleted. Our livelihood will get more difficult, like that.","Mabini"
"267",25,"3","For me, now, there are no more issues. There are no more people using sodium, there are no more using dynamite. They only dive at night to spearfish. But this is legal. ","Mabini"
"268",25,"4","","Mabini"

"271",25,"5c","There are people working in sanctuaries, and they are the ones that should be guarding. In barangays there are also people guarding. Like Joseph, the kagawad.

"275",25,"7","If we don't protect the environment, it will become more and more difficult. It is getting more and more difficult. When we arrived here, just there by the beach, we could quickly catch a lot of fish. Now, if we don't guard in the middle, the fish are getting scarcer.","Mabini"
"276",26,"1","Illegal. There are a lot if illegal activities like cyanide Sodium. Sodium here. It is a problem because it kills the semilia of fish. The small ones are dying. On land there are also a lot of issues. We need to use fertilizers when planting. It is not enough for farmers. We have to use fertilizers, and we have small yields. It is weak. Because life is difficult there.","Mabini"
"277",26,"2","The sea is valuable because it is where we get our living... The fish there. For the livelihood in the sea. There are other reasons. In my feeling the environment is important for the livelihood, especially because of its abundance. There are a lot of fish.","Mabini"
"278",26,"3","There are issues here. People using sodium. A lot there are using it. The small fish, the semilia are dying. In my opinion there are no other issues, this is really what causes damages. The illegal fishermen there.","Mabini"
"279",26,"4","We need to put bantay dagat in order to maintain the environment. To be certain there are guards. Put people that can guard. We can get bantay dagat from the barangay. There are volunteers. They can catch illegal fishermen. Here in the barangay there are a lot but there are not active. In my option there is not enough money in the barangay to pay for allowance, for a boat. Maybe the municipality could help but they don't help yet. Another solution could be to give livelihood in the sea to these illegal fishermen. An alternative to illegal activities. Other options. If they are illegal fishermen, they can become capitans. They are illegal fishermen because the income is easier. If you see the fish, you put sodium and the fish are dead instantly. If you use hook and line it takes long, if the fish are not eating, you don't catch them.","Mabini"
"280",26,"5a","Here in Oton there is no MPA yet. I know what it is, they are made for fish to lay their eggs. I think MPAs are for fish to spawn. They are growing there. Then we need to guard so that fishermen don't enter, and dont fish with nets or hook and line inside. ","Mabini"
"281",26,"5b","For locals. For everyone. Of course, the fish that are getting out, they are for everyone. There are areas, but when they are getting out, we can catch them. Outside of the sanctuary. Even for other people it is important.","Mabini"

"286",26,"7","If we don't control illegal fishermen, we will really lose the resources of the sea. They will totally be depleted. The fish will be depleted. We won't have anymore food. We won't have anymore livelihood.","Mabini"
"287",27,"1","Here, in Palawan, the worse is the use of dynamite and sodium as we call it. Because of that there are no more fish now. Because they use things like that. And the nets with small mesh as well. Because even the small fish they also catch them. But really the use of dynamite and sodium. On land, to start, in the gardens is the insects so we sometimes use spray not to get some. If there are typhoons passing as well. Also sometimes, there are droughts. There are irrigation dams but it's not everywhere, there are just a few. Transportation is an issue as well; even for our business. The roads. They are not good yet. Can I also say the energy? Because there is no electricity here at ours. It's different from the environment but it is a problem for us as well.","Mabini"
"288",27,"2","The sea is really valuable because most people get what their need there. There are people getting it from the sea and the others are farmers. The harvest, they get fruits, they plant rice And in the sea they fish. And if there are no more fish, people don't catch anymore fish. It has an impact on people. They can't afford spending money for their families. Here there is no other way. The others are working far away and have to go to far places if there are no fish. If they cannot fish they work far away.","Mabini"
"289",27,"3","Another issue here is mutual respect. For example, we culture fish, and if there are no guards they get them. We need to have guards but we can't afford giving them a salary. For the fish there are still some but compared to before there really are not that many. We are just catching very few.","Mabini"
"290",27,"4","The possible solution to these issues is to really get people that guard other people doing things like that. Because we don't solve the problem here. People here, even if they see and know it, they are like scared to accuse people doing that. So we can't control people doing illegal fishing. They are scared to accuse. But if we really have people guarding there, and denounce people working this way, not being scared, maybe we will solve it. We really need guarding.","Mabini"
"291",27,"5a","I have a small idea. Back then, they came to make one here but it did not continue. Maybe because of the budget. There was a problem. The agency of MAPAs came here and came to our barangay. But in giving support, this was lacking. The goal of MPAs is to increase the number of fish. But the problem is to give what we need to guard. That was the issue for us.","Mabini"
"292",27,"5b","It for local people here. We need it. Like for me, I don't fish but i need the fish for my business, and there is not much to buy because there are few fish.","Mabini"

"296",27,"6c","","Mabini"
"297",27,"7","I think, as far as I can see, that our barangay will develop. Because people will get ways of subsistence. Because now it is difficult for people, they have to work to further places To fish And there are also not a lot of catches. Then, working in farms is difficult as well because there are a lot of insects. And then another issue, for example for us, we want to grow vegetables. Now, the support from government is lacking for what we need to grow vegetables. So it is difficult for farmers. I think after 10 years, if we get noticed, there will be a solution. ","Mabini"
"298",28,"1","Cutting of trees. It started a long time ago. For me, thinking of Palawan, there are a lot of issues that don't stop for our environment. For example, mining. ","Mabini"
"299",28,"2","Of course because it is where we get our livelihood like fishermen. Livelihood at sea. It depends of course, because of poverty. Life is difficult And even if some things are forbidden, we need money for our families.","Mabini"
"300",28,"3","I don't know much about the fishery here. But everywhere, what I know is that we can't avoid having ways illegal fishing. And it is damaging our marine environment. It does not destroy it immediately but it takes some time. In some places, it is difficult to catch fish; they are already far away. For example the mangroves, they are being cut. Sometimes, the fish live there. ","Mabini"
"301",28,"4","A solution can be planting other mangroves.","Mabini"
"302",28,"5a","To protect the sea, the fish, the corals, like that. ","Mabini"

"309",29,"1","Illegal fishing. Because mainly of dynamite, the small fish and corals are being degraded. Sodium. That's really it. On land? Charcoal from mangroves I think also kaingin is a problem here. People from here are used to it and don't really think it is a problem. But it is a problem to the environment. It started a long time ago. Because the catch of fish are really weak here. We just get a few.","Depla"
"310",29,"2","Because for example for us, poor people, this is where we get our ways of subsistence. And we don't have anymore. If we lose our environment, we also lose what we get from it.","Depla"
"311",29,"3","Some are using legal methods, fishing with nets. It depends, and there are also others using illegal ways of fishing. Most people I see here are using nets. Also, the catch are weak, and it is really the problem for people here. It is weak because we only have the area of Depla. It is small and we can't reach until Terramar because it is forbidden there. So we just stay here, go back and forth, and going back and forth like that, fish here are really depleted. Too many fishermen.","Depla"
"312",29,"4","The solution here, is to really have bantay dagat in order to guard and avoid illegal fishermen.","Depla"
"313",29,"5a","Of course, reserves for the spawning of fish to avoid them to be depleted. That's really their goal. If we protect like this, the broken corals they will come back.","Depla"
"314",29,"5b","Of course for the community. They are the ones getting benefits from the fish going out of the protected area. When they go out of the area, fishermen can catch them.","Depla"
"315",29,"5c","They will get efficient if we get cooperation from the barangay. Community Fishermen. It will really get efficient if people from the barangay unite. That's the program. But if not no trust.","Depla"
"316",29,"6a","Sir, what I know from Pangatalan is a resort, right? I don't know if they have another goal. I know there is an MPA there because there are buoys.","Depla"
"317",29,"6b","","Depla"
"318",29,"6c","Yes we agree. This MPA is beautiful. Its goal is nice. It's protection for areas of poor peopole. When fish are increasing in numbers, then they are really numerous going out. The ones getting benefits are the fishermen","Depla"
"319",29,"7","Depla will develop. For example, if we get help from the resort of Pangatalan, we get cooperation. Help for each one. Programs, like this. Our program is beautiful because people are getting united.","Depla"
"320",30,"1","As of now In the mountains of course, there is cutting of trees, as well as in the mangroves. But of course in the sea, there is illegal fishing. The other issues... I think the environmentalists they are not opted in presenting the ones who destroy the environment. The government, the environmentalists. They are not sincere in doing their part, their job. People continue destroying our environment. They don't do their job, that's what I saw.","Depla"
"321",30,"2","Of course it has a value because we are getting our food, the fish. Food and income from the sea. Of course there is a connection with the environment, especially climate change. Because the environment of course, the corals, is already destroyed. So erosion... corals cannot control erosion, cannot control the dirt from the mountain. So there is a connection with the environment. The erosion that is caused to the ocean. The dirt go to the ocean and if there is not enough corals, corals cannot control and maybe there is also landslides. But also in the sea the trash will go down because of a lack of corals. So there is still a connection to the environment.","Depla"
"322",30,"3","The problem of the fishermen of course, is they don't have enough catch. And also the government, they are not doing their job to watch and to control the illegal fishermen. They are using dynamite and cyanide. So our government, maybe their movement is not enough. They are still sitting in their offices, not going out to give solutions or to watch. A little maybe, but not enough because our ocean is very wide.","Depla"
"323",30,"4","Maybe they will only enforce the law. Action, I need to say, they must have an action. Enforce the law so that illegal fishers will not continue doing their illegal activities. Of they should put some guards in different places like that they will not continue their illegal activities. Also the people are afraid of law but if there is no action, they will continue.","Depla"
"324",30,"5a","They have a plan here. I don't know the size of the marine protected area. Of course the purpose is the fish to lay their eggs overthere. And of course that will produce more fish. If the people will not allow to go there and catch fish there, that will reproduce. The purpose is not only to protect the mother fish but also that if it has already produced an egg, also the fisherman will benefit from that. Maybe you call that exit. If the area is already full of fish, they will go out. And the the fisherman will benefit.","Depla"
"325",30,"5b","Of course the barangay Depla, the people in barangay Depla. The fishermen. But maybe not only the fishermen, the people because they will eat also the catch.","Depla"
"326",30,"5c","Maybe we can put a guard also. It will work out like that. People have no concern, what they want is to get for today and for tomorrow They are not concerned with the future.","Depla"

"328",30,"6b","","Depla"
"329",30,"6c","","Depla"
"330",30,"7","Maybe there is no future. If the people continue to destroy, maybe the food etc., not a good result. But maybe if people prevent, maybe there is a good future. Prevent, meaning cooperate and do what is right or what is fit for the plants, for the MPA for example. They agree and watch... Maybe there is a good future, not only in the MPA but also here in the mountains. Of course officials in the barangay must be the first ones who execute. They are the people that know better the community.","Depla"
"331",31,"1","First, for me, the environment is getting damaged, linked to cyanide for example. If the environment is damaged, people will get poor. Maybe they are also doing it because of poverty. Or maybe they don't have any idea. On land, sometimes there are attacks of animals damaging the plants. For example, you are a farmer, and you planted. And animals are damaging it. Insects.","Depla"
"332",31,"2","Oh it really has a value. Of course, first, if we are not farmers, and other people are damaging our environment We will get more poor. All of us. It has a value because it is where we get our ways of subsistence. For example, I am a fisherman. And the environment gets damaged. My family gets its subsistence from there. We need to protect our environment. Just like boss Fred is doing, this is a big help, right? A big help so that fish can multiply. But there are also Filipinos that are different.","Depla"
"333",31,"3","There has been a lot of change now. Now, the damages to the environment have been quite reduced. Before, some time ago, there was cyanide, and all of that. Now the environment has started recovering. There has been a lot of protection. My estimate. Before, at the beginning it was different, there was a lot, they didn't care and used a lot of forbidden ways. Now after some time there is an effect. Now, environment will be able to recover.","Depla"
"334",31,"4","There is no other solution than help, for example, you know that if you become illegal, it's not only for you The environment, we all get benefit from it. All of us. So we give it some protection, we need to protect our environment. We should not abuse. Protection, for example, the barangay officials should execute that. They have a duty. They are the very eye that can see. Having guards is really what matters. Just like what they are doing in Pangatalan right? The security is changing a lot right?","Depla"
"335",31,"5a","The sanctuary overthere, I was there for the public hearing in Taytay. Their goal is beautiful. The small fish enter there, there are getting protection because illegal fisherman cannot enter. And when they go out Their goal really is to protect. Protection for the fish. But not only, corals as well... Have you noticed the corals planted by Thomas? I was there. I could dive! I went with him. ","Depla"
"336",31,"5b","According to me, it's not maybe for everyone. I mean, Fred made it so that the environment improves. The MPA in Pangatalan, it's for everyone. For example you put protection, it's for people as well. In Depla, the new MPA is for people in Depla. ","Depla"
"337",31,"5c","To get efficient, we need the cooperation of barangay officials so that it becomes strong. Protection from the barangay. Fishermen should not enter. These are, first, the fish of the barangay. If what they are doing good things, like saying don't have a second thought, we are really implementing it, you should not enter and everything... Like they are doing in Pangatalan, we should not enter there, because it is the very area for the fish so that they come back just as before. That's the way for Fred. He noticed there, we dived in Imorigue. We went together both of us to swim down there. ","Depla"
"338",31,"6a","Their goal is good. I can really understand the goal of Sulubaai Foundation. First, for me, it is a big help for me. Because my two kids could finish their studies. They help. Big help from boss Fred. They don't only help here, but also in other places. ","Depla"
"339",31,"6b","It is good. To improve, it depends.","Depla"
"340",31,"6c","It is good. It has no other goal than to help come back the previous corals, fish. Come back like before. Not to be damaged anymore. Because first, when they arrived they put protection on the protected area. If they did not create a protected area, oh well... There would be nothing.","Depla"
"341",31,"7","Here for people living in barangay Depla, it really depends on the opportunities of livelihood. If you don't like your work, what can you do? What mean is that you are terminated if you don't like you work. We need to give education to our kids so they can study. This will create a beautiful future. Of course for the parents, there is no more, we only can support the next generations. If parents have the intention to improve the life of their children... For the environment, we should put protection. We get there our ways of subsistence, our revenues. If there is no work in Pangatalan for example, then you have to think about what your job can be. They give a good help.","Depla"
"342",32,"1","Do you know that illegals are the worse problem here. Number one. If you are illegal like that, especially here, it is a sacrifice towards people. Cyanide for example, but now there is not much anymore. On land also we have some issues. We plant things like vegetables, but our land has no more vitamins. Our land is not fertile. It lacks of... Because, on my observations, when we plant, it does not grow. On mainland it is different from here on islands.","Depla"
"343",32,"2","Do you know, the very first and original way of subsistence here is the sea, our sea. The only issue is it that is getting difficult, the fish catch are weak. It is because of the illegal fishermen I was mentionning that it is happening. People who don't protect our ocean. For us especially here, they are the ones damaging here the corals. That's the house of the fish, if it is broken, there are no more fish, they just leave. The big corals, they will die because of sodium. That's really the first livelihood here, the sea. When I was a kid, the fish were very abundant. When I was spearfishing... now there are no more.","Depla"
"344",32,"3","","Depla"
"345",32,"4","The solution for that, maybe, for me, is to get noticed and get help. We need help, advice, on how to protect our ocean. So that our product, fish, comes back. Help it's difficult to mention. Like protection so that illegal fishermen don't enter anymore.","Depla"
"346",32,"5a","Just like we had before, this is good. Before we were in Pagpa, we are from Manaboc, because we are Tagbanua. We had areas like that. The goal was to increase the number of fish. We could not fish inside because it is the spawning ground of fish. Because this is forbidden. Because sir, from what I can hope, and it's a lot. But this is why I am asking for help, to get protection in the spawning grounds of fish. Because like we said they really do come back as long as we protect the places.","Depla"
"347",32,"5b","It's for us, for the barangay, for everyone, right? For all the area of the barangay here.","Depla"
"348",32,"5c","We need everyone from the barangay to help, they should not damage the spawning grounds of fish. If these are getting damaged, everything will die. They need to participate, to help. ","Depla"
"349",32,"6a","I know it, because many illegal fishermen have stopped. Their goal is really to help people here. Not only people from here, also in other places they help. I am really in favor of that. Everyone here in Depla is in favor. It's a big people for people from here.","Depla"
"350",32,"6b","It is really beautiful. Big help. If they are not here, it will be really difficult. Some members of my family have been working there. They also safeguard the ocean.","Depla"
"351",32,"6c","As long as they are here it will really develop. They are helping us. They safeguard the environment. They scare the illegal fishermen. No one can enter, illegal fishermen. Their MPA is good. Because first, the fish there are not decreasing in numbers. The fish are really increasing in numbers there.","Depla"
"352",32,"7","In time, in my opinion, life will become quite more beautiful here, because first, people here from islands, they are the one willing to help. They are not doing bad things. There will more resources from the sea here. They will help, only in a year maybe there can be millions of fingerlings; it is impossible that in a year the number don't increase. Now, it really is a help for safeguarding the sea, I am really in favorable to that.","Depla"
"353",33,"1","The problem here is really illegal fishermen in the sea. When they come, they use ways such as explosives, that break the corals. And then there is no more spawning ground for the fish. And it is becoming more and more difficult for fishermen here, for their livelihood, because their catch are not enough.","Depla"
"354",33,"2","The ocean is really valuable. Especially for the next generations. If it is damaged, it is bad for the next generations. They won't have any more fishery and beautiful environment. It will then really be damaged. For us as well, we need a beautiful ocean because the ocean is our livelihood. That's where we get a lot of fish for our needs. That's where we get our revenues to pay for the studies. For everyday, that's why it is valuable. Here, there is no other way of subsistence. The ocean.","Depla"
"355",33,"3","Sodium really Here sometimes we have people from other barangay that arrive and continue to get our natural resources. That's really our problem, people from other barangays coming here. And people from Depla are getting poorer. Of course if every night they come, people from here will get poorer because they don't have catch anymore. People from other areas are getting the resources. So we should protect our ocean.","Depla"
"356",33,"4","Our barangay captain here She does not really take action when it come to this. For example, going to Poblacion, Taytay. In order to denounce in higher stances people doing illegal fishing. They should go there to help us, make us noticed. Getting noticed with our barangay captain in order to control illegal fishermen. To make it forbidden... And safeguarding. We have what we call BFARMC. That's also a solution.","Depla"
"357",33,"5a","That's like the one that was created by Fred. That's good, the reason is that we get a spawning area for fish and when they grow, they also exit. And it's also for us. Also sometimes in our barangay, for the sanctuary, some don't want. They explain that they lack of resources. That's not for them, this is only for me.","Depla"
"358",33,"5b","","Depla"
"359",33,"5c","It needs a discussion with all inhabitants from Depla, to have a wide discussion. We need to get each person. ","Depla"
"360",33,"6a","I think their goal is to help each barangay near their island. I can't think of any other goal, help. ","Depla"
"361",33,"6b","For me, what they are doing is good. I agree to such things. Aside from their help to people here they also give work to people there.","Depla"
"362",33,"6c","I agree as well. The plants in the sea avoid other people.","Depla"
"363",33,"7","In the previous years, like five or ten years ago The fish back then were really numerous as compared to now. Back then, people did not get poor while catching fish. Now sir, it is extremely difficult. Sometime you go at sea and don't catch any fish. Only one fish, two fish. One kilogram. That's how difficult it is. Tomorrow, it will still be difficult to catch fish. It will continue in the future. The future will be difficult here. ","Depla"
"364",34,"1","First sir, for the fish, there are a lot of illegal fishermen like cyanide dynamite. That's a problem because everything is getting damaged. It started a long time. When I married my husband, I was already hearing it. Maybe more than fifty years. On land, there are the animals. Because in the mountains they are doing kaingin, and cutting the large trees with chainsaws. So the animals are going down and they are eating the products we are planting. Cashew, bananas... And the animals are like wild boars, monkeys...","Depla"
"365",34,"2","If there is nothing left in there it will get really difficult to get our food. The sea is giving us financial help, for us and every family. ","Depla"
"366",34,"3","Back then, Terramar was not here yet. They got buoys. Now, they put the pearls there. And they left bigs ""angkols"" in the area where we were fishing with nets. We can't lay our net there or otherwise it will get broken. The area left is really small, and it is difficult for us. Another issue is compressor, because they are powerful in getting fish. The fish are really depleted and we only get a few, sometimes it is difficult to get our food.","Depla"
"367",34,"4","We should get a resolution from the barangay to make these things forbidden here. It's actually already forbidden. But maybe what could be done is another resolution. There was a law already created but people are just keeping on doing those things. What should be done maybe is to get guards.","Depla"
"368",34,"5a","In my opinion, these are MPAs are made so that people from here don't have trouble in getting fish. At least, they have a place for spawning and people will have fish again. So that fish increase again in numbers. ","Depla"
"369",34,"5b","MPAs are for us, people from Depla.","Depla"
"370",34,"5c","We are doing a resolution from barangay officials, and this law must become implemented. This MPA will become efficient like this. That's how it will happen.","Depla"
"371",34,"6a","I've only heard. I don't really know their goal.","Depla"
"372",34,"6b","","Depla"
"373",34,"6c","For me it's okay. At least, they are protecting small areas of the sea. Like that there a lot of fish to be caught overthere. ","Depla"
"374",34,"7","Maybe after ten years or twenty wears, if there is no MPA, the fish will be picked up to the last piece. If there is an MPA, no matter what, people will still have fish to catch.","Depla"
"375",35,"1","The worse issue is about our mangroves and mountains as well. In the mountains they are doing kaingin sometimes. And sometimes the water supply is an issue too because they are cutting trees doing kaingin. The cutting of mangroves is an issue for the fishery. They are cutting the mangroves and they are the habitats of small fish. I think that's it. For the mangroves, it is affecting our fishery. Sometimes from the cutting of trees, the problem is that our water is being affected. Not much water. When the trees are cut, the quantity of water is diminishing everyday. I think kaingin started even before I was born, but the cutting of mangroves not yet. I think it started maybe over ten years ago. Like that. ","Depla"
"376",35,"2","Because that's the very place where we get our livelihood. By fishing. You know sir, there is a reason here, our former way of livelihood is seaweeds. ","Depla"
"377",35,"3","But Terramar came here, and when it is Amihan, the sea comes towards us. Now because they are here, and we cannot fish inside their area. It has affected us here in barangay Depla. The area to get squids, it is lost now. There are no more squids because their area is forbidden. That's really the reason according to me. Back then there was a lot of fish but because our fishery was affected like this, there are no more. The mangroves really affected our fishery. There are only few fish, it is really weak. ","Depla"
"378",35,"4","The solution is that people cutting mangroves have to stop, we must catch them, it would be good. What they say is that they are doing this to avoid hunger. But us, we are poor as well. They should stop so that the former numbers of fish can come back, areas to spawn... ","Depla"
"379",35,"5a","For me, the marine protected areas are good. The fish are entering there, and reproduce there. And once they are big, then we can all catch them. If there is no marine protecte areas, every one can enter. If there is protection, no matter what, they will have reproduced and the stock won't be depleted for next generations.","Depla"
"380",35,"5b","They are for us as well, of course. People from here.","Depla"
"381",35,"5c","To be efficient, we need to avoid having people who don't want to think about the next generations. The ones only thinking about right-now. But for us, what we should do is really protecting the environment for the next ones. Barangay officials, and from up there. They are the one, first, that should protect there.","Depla"
"382",35,"6a","Their goal is good, to improve the lives of people from Depla. For example they implemented a marine protected area there, this is obviously not only for them but also for us, people from here! Their goal is not only for them, it is also for barangay.","Depla"
"383",35,"6b","My opinion is that it helps people here from barangay. Like I said so that people from our barangay don't get too poor from our ways of subsistence. They could improve, by helping more the barangay to improve.","Depla"
"384",35,"6c","My opinion is that it is really good. They have an MPA there, there, the fish are also exiting from your area and then fishermen can catch them. Terramar is a big issue though. It is different from yours, which is very small; it is not everything. It is small. The problem is when it really gets big. That's the problem of Terramar.","Depla"
"385",35,"7","For example, if things like that don't stop soon, there won't be anymore ways of subsistence here like fishing. That's why the solution is that we should really stop catching natural resources in the areas where they reproduce.","Depla"
"386",36,"1","Illegal fishermen Because there are a lot of illegal fishermen here. That's a problem here for us, hook and line fishermen. Things such as cyanide. That's really what is destroying the environment. On land there are also, such as people cutting the trees. They don't cut the small trees so the big trees are depleted. I'm not sure when it started, but even when I was small it was the same.","Depla"
"387",36,"2","The ocean is valuable for us because this is where we get our subsistence from. That's where we get the money to pay for the studies of our children. So, we really protect the sea.","Depla"
"388",36,"3","Illegals They are damaging the small fish in the ocean. For the next generation, we won't have anymore. Everything is getting damaged. We should forbid these things. The consequence is that the fish don't have anymore habitat, and are getting depleted. I noticed the corals are getting cut.","Depla"
"389",36,"4","I think maybe the solution would be to dive in order to look for the fish, the illegal fishermen should do that. We should control these illegal fishermen through the union of local people from here. I think if illegal fishing stops, there will be no more problem to the fishery here.","Depla"
"390",36,"5a","Of course, protecting the natural resources of the sea. They take care of broken corals near the shore so that the fish can come back again. So that fish can multiply.","Depla"
"391",36,"5b","These MPAs are for us, for people. Because one day there will be more fish, and we won't lack of fish; of course, they are going out, right? And then we can catch them with our hook and line. That's for fish but also for fishermen. I fish around Bilaya sometimes. Not near Pangatalan. We noticed that there are more fish near, but I am scared this to be forbidden. There are a lot of semilia there, not much bigger ones, but semilia really.","Depla"
"392",36,"5c","People need to unite, and not make any trouble. The others sometimes, they are entering inside the buoys. The others, right, there are entering for illegal fishing. We must avoid these illegal fishermen.","Depla"

"396",36,"7","The life will get better. For example thanks to the studies of our children.","Depla"
"397",37,"1","On land, the big activities of kaingin. Sometimes, when the wind is strong, we can feel it. That's a problem, when we put fire to make kaingin. At sea, the problem is for the ones non involved in illegal activities. The problem at sea is illegal fishermen like dynamite, sodium. We should forbid these. This is creating problems to the marine environment. Because the corals, when there is dynamite, are getting broken, lost because of dyanmite. Sodium, when they spray it, the small fish are all dying. We should make this forbidden, because when they die as they are small, they don't grow at all. That's the problem for the marine environment. It started when the Visaya came, from Boreas, they are doing illegal activities there. Sodium. Dyanmite. Here, though, the Cuyonin and Tagbanua did not know about these illegal practices. Now they are looking at the Visaya going at sea and having big catch. They don't do illegal activities, but the Visaya do.","Batas"
"398",37,"2","The marine environment is valuable for me because it is beautiful when you see that are not destroyed and are growing. They are beautiful to see. The fish are not leaving when corals are beautiful like that. The environment is beautiful. It is valuable as well, as if there are no illegal fishermen, it is beautiful this way. That's what matters.","Batas"
"399",37,"3","There are a lot going at sea and don't get catch. The others, illegal fishermen, they have better catch. They get the catch of legal fishermen. Like dynamite, you get all the small fish this way. When you put dyanmite, everything is dead, and if you go there with legal ways, there is nothing left to catch. What I want to say, really, is that I hope that there is no more illegal fishermen. Only legal ways, that are not harmful. That's better because even if you don't catch fish, you don't damage the corals. There is more. Since a long time, there are a lot of fishermen. Now it is difficult getting fish because of all the people fishing. When the small fish are caught, they don't grow and we can't catch them. If there was no illegal fishing, we could still catch the small fish once they are big. We should forbid it. ","Batas"
"400",37,"4","The solution really, is to safeguard the environment. To avoid the things like dynamite, cyanide, sodium Even the nets, the small nets, we could forbid this. Because even the small fish are caught. Just like the baklad, our captain does not agree with that. Right there, she made it forbidden when they tried to build one here. That's really the solution, safeguarding the ocean.","Batas"
"401",37,"5a","The goal of marine sanctuary is to avoid people from other places, like El Nido, to come fishing. For them, it's forbidden to fish here in our place. Because back then for us, when we went fishing there, they made it forbidden and arrested our boats. For cuttlefish, it's forbidden to fish there. So we only fish here, and make it forbidden for them here. Each one should have its fishing ground. Our sanctuary starts from Mata, Bulua and goes until Balitbit. That's a sanctuary, it's forbidden for strangers to fish here. And only for legal ways of fishing. Dynamite is forbidden there. That's the goal of the sanctuary, avoiding strangers.","Batas"
"402",37,"5b","They are only for us, people for Batas. Like our capitain said, it is good because this way if we have visitors, they can enjoy and swim here. There can be a lot of visitors. In other places if they swim they cannot see the corals because they are destroyed by dynamite so we made dynamite forbidden here.","Batas"
"403",37,"5c","We need to protect. It can get dirty like because of kaingin. If you have floods, it will carry the chemicals from up there. And the corals will become darker and be damaged. ","Batas"

"405",37,"6b","","Batas"
"406",37,"6c","","Batas"
"407",37,"7","If we protect our marine environment here, the fish will improve here, they will increase in numbers. Just like now, we forbid dynamite here and now there are a lot of fish there. Matambaka There are a lot of matambaka around the buoys overthere. So that's the solution, guarding, so that illegal fishermen don't come here. We are the ones guarding the area here. If we hear dynamite we go there. And we arrest them. We even arrested people from here, by the buyos there. But we can only guard here.","Batas"
"408",38,"1","The means of subsistence of people. Of course, poverty. Of course, sometimes like now, it is hard to catch fish. Sometimes, it is hard to get fish with hook and line. Right? Sometimes we only catch a few. I don't really know what is the reason at sea. Maybe because of the changes in the weather... Because sometimes we have a lot of catch. And sometimes very few. On land there are also issues. For example when you plant, like bananas, and there is a typhoon. They will fall and you will not get any benefits.","Batas"
"409",38,"2","Of course, because this is where we get our means of subsistence, like the fish. When you catch fish, you sell them and it gives you the money to pay for your needs. So the ocean is valuable for us, because this is where we get our means of subsistence, right? ","Batas"
"410",38,"3","I think there is no problem here really Because of weather only. Sometimes you go at sea and you catch fish. Sometimes you got there and don't catch fish. Really I don't know why sometimes there are no catch. Fish are not eating the bait. Because of weather probably, for me. The fish are not eating the bait. There are also some weathers where we catch a lot. There are some stories, from old people that back then there was a lot of fish. I don't really know. Maybe it is the same.","Batas"
"411",38,"4","We can't really solve the problem of weather Right?","Batas"
"412",38,"5a","So that the fish multiply there. They grow and then they exit. We protect so that fish are growing there. They are spawning there, in the corals. When they are already big, they exit. They lay their eggs over there, in protected areas, sanctuaries.","Batas"
"413",38,"5b","For the environment! Isn't it correct? It's also for people. For everyone, in the barangay for example. This is for people. Only for us. So that when people from the barangay are fishing with hook and line, they catch a lot of fish. Of course There are a lot of fish left. If we don't keep an area for spawning, the fish will get depleted. There won't be anymore reproducers. But if we don't fish there, the reproducers will increase in numbers. ","Batas"
"414",38,"5c","Efficient? We need to protect these areas. Protecting, people should not enter there, should not fish. Taking care so that the fish can be growing. They should not break the corals so that the fish have a spawning ground. That's what we should be doing there. Protecting these areas so that the fish lay their eggs there.","Batas"

"419",39,"1","The trash Sometimes there are a lot of trash in the environment. What else A lot of children also! A lot  of kids! Duterte said that two or three kids is good and we should not exceed this. Only until two to three. Also, life is expensive. ","Batas"
"420",39,"2","It is valuable because this is where people have their livelihood. This is where they get their food for eveyday. That's it.","Batas"
"421",39,"3","The problem is that sometimes the weather is strong, waves are strong. When waves are big, we don't catch a lot of fish. That's climate I can't think of anything else.","Batas"
"422",39,"4","Just like our dad is doing, when waves are big, he goes to the mountains to avoid the sea. He has plantations. We don't only get our food from the sea! In the mountains there is as well. Bananas. Fruits.","Batas"
"423",39,"5a","Their goal is to forbid fishing in these areas. There are buoys. The goal is to protect these areas. So that people from other places don't enter.","Batas"

"431",40,"2","Of course for our children. For the next generations. Of course, if they don't have anymore catch, our children will get poor. It will be hard for them to have a livelihood. That's where we get our ways of subsistence, for the family.","Batas"
"432",40,"3","It is difficult to catch fish for fishermen. Probably because everything is getting damaged, even the small fish, the semilia that don't have anymore good habitat, because of illegal fishermen. In my opinion it is rare, it is mostly strangers. It has started a long time ago. Another problem is when Terramar is spraying their medicine, there are fish dying here. Then, back then we had seaweeds here, they were damaged as well. It looks like it is because of their spray. They use it so that the small insects and algae die. It was a long time ago, maybe over three years. We experienced it here. Until here up to the pontoon, seaweeds died and there were fish as well.","Batas"
"433",40,"4","We need to be efficient in the guarding.","Batas"
"434",40,"5a","Like what there was before at the place of Giovanni. Their goal is to protect near the places so that people from other areas don't enter.

If you fish with hook and line there, you catch a lot of fish. Back then here, the issue was hulbot, but now there are no more. The big boats that use large nets, like trawls. But bigger than trawls. A really big boat. There are not really much issues here in the Shark Fin Bay. The only problem, sometimes, people from other barangays are coming. But if we see them, we directly tell them to go away. Fishermen from other places. If we see that, we forbid it. They don't use bad methods, the issue is only that many people have needs here. If the others are catching our resources we cannot catch them anymore. Here in front of Batas it is really forbidden. In front of Tandol overthere, Doctor Perlo is also protecting overthere.","Batas"

"467",43,"5a","Marine sanctuaries Their are made to increase the number of fish. It is a spawning ground. That's where they reproduce. If there is no sanctuary, anyone can enter and fish. People from other places. That is why we implemented a sanctuary. ","Batas"

"473",43,"7","Maybe the future will be bad after some time. All the environment might be completely depleted. Back then, maybe ten years ago, there were a lot of fish here. Now there are no more fish. Just a few. It means that after some time, it will really get depleted. They are really decreasing in numbers. Every three years we can really notice that fish stocks are getting reduced. Even if there is a sanctuary... It might be because of overpopulation. Too many people. So many people are catching fish. So people going at sea, sometimes, they don't catch any fish.","Batas"
"474",44,"1","There are many issues. In farming, we have a lot of issues there. Like the spray for the spray we use in the rice fields, it is damaging our rice fields. Insecticides. Because of the pests and diseases, we can lose our harvest. We have a spray that kills the insects, it is better with this spray than without. For the marine environment, there is not much issue. The sea is still quite abundant. There is no problem at sea.","Batas"
"475",44,"2","That's where the future of people comes from. Like the fishermen. That is where they get their needs to pay for their children's education. And for their livelihood. The sea is still very valuable for us.","Batas"
"476",44,"3","For us, we have a lot of people who want to make benefits. And we don't have any more fish to buy. People also need to buy. They buy all the fish from people with nets, and sell them. If you have a culture of fish, it means your way of living is easy. Getting money from it is easier. People with fish cages are earning more money. That's really the problem, benefits only. There are no other issues I think.","Batas"
"477",44,"4","The solution is that if you have a cage, if you have a net, with live fish, if you have benefits benefits, you can keep on doing fish culture. There should only be nets, if you have a net, you have food for your culture. We should have help to buy the semilia, to buy the cages, from the government. If you don't have a net, you cannot get fish to feed your culture of fish. That's our problem: getting benefits. ","Batas"
"478",44,"5a","I think the goal of marine sanctuaries is for fish to multiply. It is a place for them to spawn. The sanctuary is right in front, on the way out. We cannot fish there.","Batas"
"479",44,"5b","They are for us, people from here. Once the fish are big, they are going out and we can catch them, of course. Here it is forbidden to fish inside the sanctuary. But sometimes, we cannot avoid to have people catching fish for subsistence. Even if it forbidden, people are just like that. You know, the kids only are fishing there. Older people don't.","Batas"

"488",45,"4","It would be good to have a solution. We should be firm in our place. So that illegal fishermen from other places do not come in. Guarding. If you are firm in your barangay, they will not come in, they will be scared to come in. Even only catching them.","Batas"

"496",46,"1","I cannot really answer Environmental issues At sea, there are few fish. Even now when fishing with the net, we sometimes don't catch fish. It is getting depleted maybe. Now there are a lot of people. Back then, there were few people here in the barangay. There was a lot of fish. My husband is a spearfisher. Back then, in two hours only, he could get a lot of fish. Now... well he is old and cannot really dive anymore. But back then, really, there were a lot of fish. He used a spear. Now there are a lot of ways to catch fish. Maybe the number of people is the reason, but there are also some people using dynamite (sign with the hand). You have heard. On land, it depends, there can be pests on our rice, and it can die because of that.","Batas"
"497",46,"2","If we don't protect it, in a few years we will not catch any more fish. We won't have any more food. If we don't have food, we get hungry. Even if we have rice, we also need other food.","Batas"

"507",47,"1","Here, I have not seen any problem on land. There are not much erosion and landslides compared to other provinces. Our forests are still quite intact. Still complete. So we avoided landslides here. When it comes to the sea, we forbid here the big fishing boats coming in and damaging our corals. So here, there are only small fishermen and it is okay. I have not seen many problems here. For the whole Palawan I am not really sure. I can only talk about here. But for other places I cannot really explain.","Mabini"
"508",47,"2","Because that is where we get our subsistence from. Food and money. So that we can sustain the lives of our fellows. The sea feeds a lot of people.","Mabini"
"509",47,"3","What I said in our barangay, there are some people from other barangay coming in and they are pursuing illegal activities. In our barangay there are no illegal fishermen. They enter here and they use whatever illegal way of fishing. I could not really estimate the evidences, but I have the feeling that they are using chemicals, cyanide, and then compressors. So that's the problem. We have not yet caught them, but they are from other barangays. I could not really tell from which barangay they are but no matter what they do come here. Corals are dying and fish are decreasing in numbers. Of course, corals are the habitat of the fish. That's their home. They lay their eggs over there. But when damaged, the fish are repelled from their houses. So that's automatic, they cannot multiply, right? So the small fish are dying and their population is decreasing in numbers. So we are getting poorer. Our fishermen are getting poorer, their catch are decreasing.","Mabini"
"510",47,"4","The solution maybe for illegals is to implement the law. First, we should implement it. If law is not implemented it is not good. For every illegal fisherman to get caught. Then if their are caught, then the government can put in place programs of livelihood so that our illegal fishermen stop their illegal activities. But if they really do not want to hear, we just put them in jail. That's the solution, making law effective. Livelihood projects are good. Other illegal fishermen don't have a brain. They just damage and get the money. They don't care. They don't care about the next generations. They are just illegal fishermen, this is their way of thinking. But us, we are protecting the environment, we are thinking about the next generations. That is like that here.","Mabini"
"511",47,"5a","We have a marine sanctuary here in Mabini. But our problem is to sustain it, we cannot sustain it because the barangay's funds are too little. It is difficult. To sustain it you need a real small house for the guard. Then you need to give a salary. To secure the whole sanctuary. We have a declaration in El Nido. The goal of sanctuaries is for fish to breed. It is a breeding station. A spawning ground. The sanctuaries are strict, there should be nobody coming in. No matter whom, should not enter. That is where they lay their eggs, that is where they multiply their populations. So that is why we created it. The fish live over there, when they are still small. When bigger, they exit the sanctuary, and we can catch them.","Mabini"
"512",47,"5b","It is for people from here. We made it for people here. For our constituants.","Mabini"
"513",47,"5c","To be efficient, we need the implementation. First, the funds. That's where we lost. People is not an issue, there are a lot. But we need the funds to give people a salary. So we first build the small house for a guard, and then we give a salary to the guard. We sustain it. And then, people studying marine biodiversity, can maintain it. We had people diving here from El Nido Foundation to study the area. It is the El Nido Foundation that helped the barangay to create the MPA. So I am really grateful towards El Nido Foundation because they helped. But every month, they are diving and looking at the corals to see if they increase or decrease, and the same with the fish. They are studying this. A month ago maybe they dived.","Mabini"

"517",47,"7","About the future, like I said, if the implementation of the law is effective, in my opinion we will sustain the environment. But if we abandon it this way, it will get damaged. Because the population is really increasing. But if law is strictly implemented, it is sure that we will sustain it. But in my opinion, because of our provincial government, is creating laws to protect our mountains, sea. And our DENR. They don't abandon right? So we will maintain.","Mabini"
"518",48,"1","Of course, climate change, the changes in weather. In Palawan there are floods as well. The environment It means the green of the world! Climate change is not all. In the sea, we cannot avoid illegal fishermen. We still cannot control it. There are less and less fish.","Sandoval"
"519",48,"2","The sea is valuable because its products are the food of people. They eat fish and that's where they come from. All the types of food, shells There are many products in the sea. That's the same as on land there are also many products on land.","Sandoval"
"520",48,"3","I am not sure about the fish because I am working here on land. But now the population is really increasing. It needs food from the sea. Because if there are few people, there are a lot of fish. Now there are a lot of people, many people are eating the fish.","Sandoval"
"521",48,"4","The solution is maybe to cultivate fish. Right? There are cultures of fish. Fish cages. There are fish farms. For the bangus.","Sandoval"
"522",48,"5a","Their are made to protect the sea. To conserve and protect the spawning grounds of fish. So they have a shelter, a habitat, undisturbed. I know that because of Pangatalan, Fred, the marine sanctuary.","Sandoval"
"523",48,"5b","Everyone get benefits from MPAs. Because what Fred is doing, the MPA overthere, it is to protect the fish. The ones laying eggs. Then, they are growing and fishermen can catch them. They are the ones getting benefits. ","Sandoval"
"524",48,"5c","There should be guards. It should be forbidden for illegal fishermen using sodium to enter.","Sandoval"

"529",49,"1","Environmental issues. For me, it is quite normal, there are not much issues. It has been a long time I have been here and it is still quite normal. There are illegal fishermen sometimes only. Small time. There are no big time illegal fishermen.","Batas"
"530",49,"2","It matters for people's lives. It is valuable for Palawan's local people's health. Palawan is wild. The ocean is valuable for fishermen for example. For the future. For the food of local people, it is important. If there is no fish, there is no money to buy rice. This is our way of subsistence here in Palawan. For money of course! If you don't have fish, you don't have money. The environment is valuable.","Batas"

The future is beautiful; I am not scared as long as there are no illegal fishermen. There is no need to be scared for the environment as long as there are no illegal fishermen.","Batas"
"540",50,"1","Of course, the main issue is illegal fishing. We cannot avoid it because life is difficult in Palawan. People here did not all graduate from college, or even just highschool. But now people, their children are already studying hard. It is easier to get a job if you have graduated, only from highschool. Now help has arrived, and they are looking for highschool graduates. So now they are really studying. Illegal fishing is an issue, not everyone uses legal methods. Some are illegal. Like dynamite. Cyanide, just a little bit. Dynamite, more. Because they need food for their culture of fish. Not only the small fish, they also get bigger fish, chop them and feed their fish. On land, there is kaingin. I am not sure if it is an issue, because they used to do it before, waiting three years before burning. Now the old way of doing it is coming back. DENR is telling that it is forbidden but I don't really know why. Maybe if there are big trees getting cut. Maybe this is why it is forbidden.","Batas"
"541",50,"2","Because this is where people get their livelihood, especially here. That is the very livelihood and way of subsistence of people from here. The sea, and farming only. That's it only, livelihood and mean of subsistence for people. Because they get the money to pay for their family's needs.","Batas"
"542",50,"3","There is not much issue. Maybe there are few fish, it might be the issue. Even here in Batas there are few fish left. The fish are already far away. Here, near, there are only few fish. I don't know why? Maybe global warming is the issue. The climate of the sea. I mean climate change.","Batas"
"543",50,"4","Maybe to have a hatchery. There are seasons for the fish. Here there is a season where you can get groupers. This is a good solution. The time of reproduction for groupers is a closed season for fishing. Corals are quite damaged because of former practices. Now illegal fishing has just came back a little bit. Maybe we reached a time where the world is changing.","Batas"
"544",50,"5a","Here, this is a sanctuary, in front. The goal is to forbid ways of fishing, especially the nets. It is okay for the nets with bigger mesh because you get big fish.

"617",57,"1","Illegal fishing, such as dynamite.. Also, illegal cutting of mangroves.","Silangga"
"618",57,"2","Because the ocean is where lives the sea's natural resources. For example, food. If we throw our trash there, it goes at sea. And the ocean becomes dirty. It becomes affected at low tide.","Silangga"
"619",57,"3","There is illegal fishing. Also there is the cutting of mangroves. This is an issue because this is where fish are spawning. ","Silangga"
"620",57,"4","The solution actually, for illegal fishing, is to implement the laws and regulations regarding illegal fishing. We can prevent that practices. In the barangay we have to apply it first, make punishments to those who are involved in those practices.","Silangga"
"621",57,"5a","The goal of MPAs is for the fish to be able to spawn again. Also, for the corals to develop.","Silangga"

"624",57,"6a","Actually, I was there at the beginning when they decided a place would become a sanctuary. Their goal is to eliminate all illegal activities around Pangatalan Island.

For every visitors that want to go there.","Silangga"
"625",57,"6b","It is good, because I know that before this area and corals used to be quite dead already. Then when I was there, they hired a person to promote the coral plantation.","Silangga"
"626",57,"6c","It's good because the marine environment will be protected.","Silangga"
"627",57,"7","Actually, Palawan is the last frontier. But in my own opinion, we can preserve the area for this barangay. Not also the surroundings, the oceans here in Taytay. And we will be admired by other countries. To be a good example.","Silangga"

"639",59,"1","For the sea, there is what they call ""boom boom"", or dynamite, right? Because when they do that, we don't have any more fish to catch. The fish are dying. Yeah dynamite. Also there are the trash, making the ocean dirty. Right? On land, the problem is kaingin. We should not practice kaingin. Because if you are doing kaingin, and then it rains, we are getting floods.","Sandoval"
"640",59,"2","Well the ocean is our livelihood! This is where we are getting our income. If we catch fish, we get our income. If not, we are sad. We don't have fish to sell.","Sandoval"
"641",59,"3","For me the issue is really their dynamite. If they are fishing with dynamite, there are no big fish. Sometimes there are catch, sometimes there are no. It depends on the weather, if the weather is good, like now, we catch fish. The weather is good now for our baring.","Sandoval"
"642",59,"4","We should have bantay dagat.","Sandoval"
"643",59,"5a","Yes in Pangatalan, there are buoys there. The goal of marine sanctuaries is maybe so that people don't get their products. Like Terramar, they are planting pearls. And it is forbidden to enter there.","Sandoval"

There could be different kinds of tourism. It depends on our government as well. Tourists want to sea the view here, also resorts here, Club Noah, Noah Noah, Pangatalan... Here is a way to go there. There is also Flower Island. We are near the airport, and near the sea; here, is like a way to go there.","Silangga"

"672",62,"1","There are a lot of illegal fishermen. They are using illegal methods, and it is quite difficult for us here in Palawan. There are different methods. Some are using dynamite for example. On land there are cutting the large trees.","Silangga"

"685",63,"3","Here, when fishing with our net, it is difficult to catch fish. Maybe it is because there are a lot of illegal fishermen.","Sandoval"
"686",63,"4","I hope there were more controls. There should be more controls at sea. Maybe it is good if there are guards so that illegal fishermen don't come in our seas.","Sandoval"

"691",63,"6b","What they are doing is good. For example here, we have a request from the fisherfolk's organization to help us build a small house to have our meetings, and this help would be great.","Sandoval"
"692",63,"6c","Their MPA is good, it is effient because they are guarding it. There are a lot of fish, they are big. Because if there is no MPA, even if the fish are small, they are getting caught.","Sandoval"
"693",63,"7","Maybe the future will be good if this MPA is continuing. Like that, the fish will be more numerous and we will be able to catch them with our nets. This is a big help for our future.","Sandoval"
"694",64,"1","First, for the ocean, the situation is dangerous. Because almost all corals are damaged because of illegal fishermen using dynamite, cyanide. Maybe like that. Then, when it comes to the forests, we also cannot avoid the cutting of large trees. And this causes floods. It has a big effect to people down in the villages.","Sandoval"
"695",64,"2","For me the ocean is valuable because this is where we get our daily means of subsistence. This is a great support for us everyday: food. This is where we get our livelihood.","Sandoval"
"696",64,"3","Here we cannot avoid having trash. Also sometimes there are illegal fishermen. They don't take care of our environment, damaging it. There are less and less fish compared with before. When you used to fish, you would get big fish. Now just a few, and small fish. It is very rare to catch big fish.","Sandoval"
"697",64,"4","For me the solution is people to help, especially barangay officials, the capitain, and people who are protecting and cleaning the ocean. Then ""palibot"" for the land and ocean. We also need to protect corals, in order to get a lot of fish and so that fish don't die. We will get a lot of fish if we implement a marine protected area. For me this is okay. For illegal fishermen people need to unite here and find better livelihoods so that illegal fishermen using dynamite or sodium stop. This way, our barangay and people will be developing.","Sandoval"
"698",64,"5a","The goal of marine protected areas is, first, to protect the ocean. Get better habitats for fish so that their populations increase. So that they lay more eggs and have more fish to live in these marine protected areas. Then, it can become a solution for people not to get poorer in their livelihood at sea. Of course, for the food as well.","Sandoval"
"699",64,"5b","MPAs are for us, people from here, we are benefitting from them. The kids as well for the next generation.","Sandoval"
"700",64,"5c","First, they need to have security guards so that illegal fishermen do not enter. In order to properly guard the marine protected area. ","Sandoval"
"701",64,"6a","First, they are helping a lot of people in each barangay, in order to protect the ocean. Also, to have more fish in the ocean.","Sandoval"
"702",64,"6b","My opinion is that it is a big help for people here. It is not only for the different barangays but also for the whole Taytay. I suggest that they help every barangay to protect the ocean, they could have a beautiful influence. For example, for people.","Sandoval"
"703",64,"6c","Yes, it is very efficient, I saw that there are a lot of fish there. Also, the fish are not scared there, they are not scared of people. They smell you. Then, there are a lot of fish inside the marine protected area of Sulubaai.","Sandoval"
"704",64,"7","For me, if the behaviour of people does no change, it will become the cause of poverty, especially for fishermen. It will have a big effect to people here, because it is the livelihood of most people here. This is where they get their subsistence from everyday, the fish. So, it will have big impact if we don't protect the ocean. People will get more poor.","Sandoval"
"705",65,"1","Maybe the issue here is that there are too many fishermen. Then, too many fishermen here. There are a lot of people here. Also, maybe, too many compressors, there are a lot of compressors and this is what is the most efficient to catch fish. Then they dive and catch sea cucumbers. The fish are not scared because they are diving at night. And they catch them, wether big or small because it is at night. Also they dive very deep and fish are not really depleted there. In other places the big fish are completely depleted, and they cannot reproduce. On land, for me, it's like there are not much issues on land. ","Sandoval"
"706",65,"2","Of course, because this is where we get our means of subsistence, fishing. This is our office, our work. If we lose the ocean, we will also probably die because we would not have any more food. We get a lot of food there, and if we can exchange our vegetables, if we can also exchange our rice, we can sell the fish to people to get money. This is why the ocean is very valuable.","Sandoval"
"707",65,"3","Maybe there are way too many fishermen as well. Also there are illegal fishermen. They have a big effect. When the fish are smelling the chemicals they are using, they just leave of course! Then corals are weakening. That is for sure, also for the fish, they are also dying.","Sandoval"
"708",65,"4","I think the solution would be to protect, just like in Dipnai. They have a sanctuary over there. Maybe the area is 200 by 200, there are buoys and a lot of fish according to people from Silanga. People from there like to fish there. They get a lot of oblong there. They don't fish near, they go inside. We call that ""subid-subid"", you fish while running. The security does not notice because they think the boat is only passing by, but they are actually fishing (laughters).","Sandoval"
"709",65,"5a","Maybe to protect the ocean, so that fish are increasing in numbers.","Sandoval"
"710",65,"5b","Of course, MPAs are for us. If the fish are increasing in numbers, this is also good for us fishermen, and for all the people. If we catch a lot of fish, people are having a lot of food! If we don't catch a lot, well they don't have food. And we are also affected: if we only catch few fish, we also don't get big profits. Not enough to pay for everyday's needs of our families.","Sandoval"
"711",65,"5c","Maybe there needs to be guards. But it should not be a guard catching fish (laughters).","Sandoval"
"712",65,"6a","The solution of Sulubaai is good, they are giving protection and means to create sanctuaries for barangays. So that there is protection, there is a reserve for every barangay for their ocean. There could be more and more fish because fish stocks are not damaged and they can spawn. When they are bigger, they exit from the area, because if there are too much fish there is not enough food in one place, right? If there is too much fish, the area is full and they are exiting. But it depends, some fish like kalan are not really going far away. Danggit as well. Mangagat.","Sandoval"
"713",65,"6b","It is good. Because they are acting in favour of fishermen. It is good for fishermen. They put in place protection, sanctuary. Maybe to improve they could put in place more protection to protect these areas and so that people don't enter. We need that for fish to reproduce and improve.","Sandoval"
"714",65,"6c","I think their sanctuary is efficient. There are a lot of fish there! It is forbidden to fish there. Whatever the way. It means over there, fish are increasing in numbers. ","Sandoval"
"715",65,"7","Well if this does not stop, illegal fishing, the destruction of our environment, poor us, people from sandoval Poor us. It is dangerous. If fish are getting scarce, there will be nothing left, and poor Sandoval. Most people here in Sandoval are fishermen. And if they are not fishermen, they still eat the fish. It is free do get fish. They will have to find money from other things. Fur us, fishermen, if we catch a lot of fish, if the ocean is healthy, of course we always get a lot of fish and a lot of money. We get 500 pesos, we get 700 pesos. Everyday! That is better because sometimes it can be only 200 pesos.","Sandoval"
"716",66,"1","Maybe more on policy-making. For me it is more on policy-making because there is no implementation of the law. There is a lack of enforcement. The security of the people and natural resources is not very secured. They don't have a lack in implementation. The consequence is that most of the illegal fishers are just doing illegal things. Also, illegal traders or poachers. Also maybe climate change. Mining also. Irresponsible mining. ","Puerto Princesa"
"717",66,"2","For me nature is very important because we are living on it, we depend on it and as the most rational species of animals we are the one who should be the most responsible in taking care of it. For me the ocean is very important because the Philippines is an archipelagic country, and around sixty percent of the population is situated in coastal areas. So for me it is very important.","Puerto Princesa"
"718",66,"3","Maybe it's more on illegal fishing also, because other than the lack of implementation, the Shark Fin Bay is quite far from the reach of implementation body. Actually I am not very familiar with the issues in the Shark Fin Bay so this is the things that I acknowledge. Actually, I just learned from our trip in Pangatalan and you talked about the Shark Fin Bay, maybe some of the islanders lack knowledge about the regulations around the ocean or around the marine protected area. ","Puerto Princesa"
"719",66,"4","For me it's not just on policy-making. The solution to that is a more active participation of the community. Better implementation from the implementing body. And lastly, funds. I mean, as far as I know, the two main issues of community-based MPAs are the lack of financial support and lack of manpower.","Puerto Princesa"
"720",66,"5a","Most commonly in the Philippines, MPAs are community-based so its true goal is for the fishery conservation. But it's not all on conservation purposes. It's to increase the catch and economic status of the people. It's more on that. Mostly, MPAs are created or established not just to conserve the resources themselves, but also to increase the socio-economic status of the people living around the area.","Puerto Princesa"
"721",66,"5b","It's really the people. Fisherfolks. The neighboring community. ","Puerto Princesa"
"722",66,"5c","Community support. For me that's the most important because as far as I know, 95% of the MPAs in the Philippines are community-based. So, the bottum-up management should be strenghtened. And the involvement of the people is very important. We should let them know about the true goal of the MPA so they can support the implementation of the MPA. Other than the community support, maybe the active implementation body. The management organization should have an appropriate technical support. Sustainable funding. And more manpower. ","Puerto Princesa"
"723",66,"6a","As for me, for my own judgement, as I have observed during our Pangatalan trip, Sulubaai is very effective in implementing the main goal of an MPA. They are very effective because the people living near Pangatalan Island are aware about the MPA and its goals.","Puerto Princesa"
"724",66,"6b","I guess for the advice is that maybe at the end of the project other barangay should be a goal because they have boats and can travel. Because of that they can do illegal things if they are not fully aware. If the implementation goal does not reach other parts of the island, other barangays, maybe they can still do illegal fishing. I know Sulubaai is very active in implementing its conservation initiatives around the Pangatan Island. Maybe they can communicate also well or can have an active collaboration with the LGU of Taytay. Not just being along in implementing those regulations. The Taytay LGU can help and as a result they can be empowered and learn some things in terms of technical skills and capabilities.","Puerto Princesa"
"725",66,"6c","According to the managers, when they went there, when they started the MPA, the whole island was ruined or maybe depleted. And I guess it is very effective, it's actually my first time to see the planted corals. So I am very amazed about how organized or specific your methods in handling the conservation and increasing of depleted natural resources of the island. ","Puerto Princesa"
"726",66,"7","It is complicated because in terms of politics or in terms of the geography, Palawan shall be divided into three. Taytay will be the center of the Palawan de Norte so in termes of implementation, if it's true that Palawan shall be divided in to three, in terms of implementation maybe good things will happen I guess. Because of the small scale administration. The small scale of the area that can be handled under the administration. The local government. I am just looking for that actually. I am just hoping that all the promises from the government about easy access of the services, for the people, I am just hoping that it will happen in the future. The MPA implementation shall be easier for the managers. If Palawan is not divided into three, for me, the future I guess is that more NGOs are going to establish their conservation initiatives here in Palawan and because if the division of Palawan will not happen, Taytay will be... As compared to El Nido, Taytay has far lesser number of tourists. So maybe because of less tourists, the carrying capacity will be depleted. Hence, Taytay Bay will not be depleted compared as if there is a lot of tourists out there. ","Puerto Princesa"
